Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.	Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.	Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.

There's no point both of us getting wet.	I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.	Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.	Yes.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Oh....Say something.	Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Brad, please lets get out of here.	For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.	I hope so my darling.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.

And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.	If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Hello.	Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?

You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never	I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?	Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.	Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!	...It's very American.

We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.	Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.	I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --	Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.	It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.	I agree.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.	The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --	Creed is down!!!
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.	Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.	There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.	No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --	Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
I say ya nothin'!	What's happenin' here?
What's happenin' here?	I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
You can forget about sparring, kid.	Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!	Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.	Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Yo' yellow, old man.	Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!	Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!

Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.	I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.	It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.

It ain't your locker no more.	Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?	Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.	Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.	Creed's great.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?	'Bout what?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.	He ain't losin' nothin'.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.	Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!

What kinda business?	Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.	Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.	I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.	Maybe another job is the best thing.
Maybe another job is the best thing.	Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.

Ain't sure, what's the story?	What?

Ya really like her?	Sure I like her.
Sure I like her.	What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?	I dunno -- she fills gaps.

Outta my house I want ya!!	...It's cold outside, Paulie.
...I can't haul meat no more.	What can I do about it?
What can I do about it?	Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.	What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?	...People talk to me more.
...People talk to me more.	How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.	Apollo's a great fighter.
Apollo's a great fighter.	Do you feel you have a chance?
Do you feel you have a chance?	Maybe --
I'll tear his head off.	Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?	Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?	Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.	How will you fight Apollo Creed?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?	Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?	Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.	And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?	Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
We don't serve formula. Snookums.	You serve martinis, doncha?
You serve martinis, doncha?	Yeah...
Oh, a ladies man, huh?	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.	Well, I'll be...
Well, I'll be...	So what's your next move, Valiant?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.	So where is it then?
So where is it then?	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.	Shoulda guessed.
Shoulda guessed.	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
What's this, Roger?	A tweeting bird?
A tweeting bird?	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.	Is this paper even good?
Is this paper even good?	Check the scrawl.
Check the scrawl.	R.K. Maroon.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?	Bastards put him on notice.
Do you think the rabbit did it?	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?	He's a Toon... who cares?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
He's a riot.	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?	It's all yours.
So you decided to help him after all?	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
So what's the scam, Eddie?	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
What was <u>that</u>?	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.	Maroon, right?
Maroon, right?	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
What's that comin' from the bar?	Sounds like singin'.
Sounds like singin'.	Oh, no...
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.	I'll bet.
I'll bet.	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?	Ask her...
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They must've taken it off me.	They?
They?	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.	So you're Cloverleaf?
So you're Cloverleaf?	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.	What the hell's a freeway?
What the hell's a freeway?	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!	Surprised?
Surprised?	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
You?	That's right, me.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?	Toon cops worked me over.
Toon cops worked me over.	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.	What am I, Earl?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.	No...
No...	Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?	Toons aren't given imperfections.
Toons aren't given imperfections.	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.	No, no, no... I love my husband.
No, no, no... I love my husband.	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
So altruistic.	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
You shot Roger.	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	I didn't know who I could trust.
I didn't know who I could trust.	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.	Where is he?
Where is he?	He's right here in the...
How did you get onto Doom?	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
So where is it?	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.	A joker to the end.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?	He made me laugh.
Hold on a second.	Eddie, come on.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.	That's what you woke me up for?
Now what?	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.	What a gasser.
What a gasser.	Wait here...
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
What's with the dip?	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
What the hell is that?	Doom.
Doom.	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?	One too many safes dropped on his head?
One too many safes dropped on his head?	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.	So what do you want me to do?
So what do you want me to do?	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.	I don't work in Toontown.
I don't work in Toontown.	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.	So's the job.
I got him on loan from Disney.	Aren't you the lucky one...
When will I hear from you?	As soon as is humanly possible.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...	Sure, Valiant, sure...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.	I've already seen your photographs.
I've already seen your photographs.	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?	Have you got the will?
Have you got the will?	Maybe.  Why?
Maybe.  Why?	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.	Stop what?
Valiant!  You surprised me.	That was the idea.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
You got the will in there, don't ya?	No, I don't.
No, I don't.	You tricked me, damn you!
You tricked me, damn you!	Take it easy.
Take it easy.	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.	Divorce?  Never!
Aah!	Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.	Don't ever forget that.
Does this help?	Yeah, that's better.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
The habeus corpus is thickening.	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.	How do you know that?
How do you know that?	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Hey, don't I get an encore?	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.

I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?	My brother.  Get inside.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?	We can't do anything till it's dark.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?	Me.
Me.	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?	What is this, Twenty Questions?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.	A Toon?  Noooo.
A Toon?  Noooo.	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.

Safe?	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
I'll get it.	Get away from there.
Wrong number?	No, it's not.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.	Forget it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?	Two bits.
Two bits.	I rest my case.
If I don't make it back here by ten...	Yeah?
Yeah?	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
What the hell are you doin' in there?	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.	Yeah...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?	Yeah?
Yeah?	I think you oughta read it to her.
I think you oughta read it to her.	Good idea.
Keep reading...	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
No, kid, you're a real hero.	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?	Only time will tell.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?	From this box here...
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.	I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie.

Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.

As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.	And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Juliet!	O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
I come for my lady Juliet.	Welcome.
Welcome.	Where is my Lady's lord?
Where is my Lady's lord?	Romeo, come forth.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.	Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.	She'll not come down tonight.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.	Madam, in happy time what day is that?

Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.	O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.

Juliet!	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off.

This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!

Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.	True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.

If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.	Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Nurse.	Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all

You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.	I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.	So where do you go from here?
So where do you go from here?	I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.	I'm up for that...
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.	Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?	The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.	And who are you?
So what's the deal?	The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.	Which leads us to...
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.	And then...
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.	How do we know that?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...	That's why you were riding with him.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?	Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.	What is?
What is?	Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.	Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.	Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.	Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?	I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.	Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.	And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?	It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.	So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?	It's been known to happen.
It's been known to happen.	Not to me, you know that.
Not to me, you know that.	I thought I did.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!	Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?	Nothing.
What in bloody hell is going on?	They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.	From Interpol?
From Interpol?	That's him.
Lose them!	You lose them!
About time!	Not yet...
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?	They're good!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.	Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.	You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...	Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Do I need to repeat myself?	No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.	You were a soldier, were you?
You were a soldier, were you?	Once.
Hazard pay...	The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...	We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?	I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.	I still am.
I still am.	Is that right?
Is that right?	That's right.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.	Nobody's saying they don't.
Nobody's saying they don't.	And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.	I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.	You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.	I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.

You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.	Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
I better be getting that.	Duty calls?
Duty calls?	Just business.
Now, what did we steal?	I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.	Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.	Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...

And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...	That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.	Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?	I'm a patriate.
I'm a patriate.	Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.	Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.	I didn't say I was.
I didn't say I was.	Bloody fucking hell...
Are you alright?	Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.	Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Who are you?  IRA?	Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?	These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
It's quite satifactory.	Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.	I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...

You sure about this?	I'd stake my reputation.
I'd stake my reputation.	But would you stake your life, that's the question...
But would you stake your life, that's the question...	In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?	I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.	Next.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...	Ready when you are...
Where's the case?	There's a problem...
That fucking figures...	Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.	Don't do it, Sam!
Don't do it, Sam!	Shut up!
Shut up!	He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.	I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.	That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.	I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.	We'll double your price.
We'll double your price.	Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Really?  Do you have the money with you?	Do you have the material?
Do you have the material?	You first, Edvard.
You first, Edvard.	Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...	I think not.  After you...
Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?
Not so fast.  Who's that?	He's company.
He's company.	Bad company...
Bad company...	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Here's yours.	There's been a slight problem.
There's been a slight problem.	What's that?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.	I take it you still want the money...
I take it you still want the money...	Of course.
Where's my information?	In here...
In here...	Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?	No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.	Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.	Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.	I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.	Enough!
And more importantly --	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
We'll die if we stay here!	You'll die if you leave here.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.	I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!	It is, I'm telling you it is!!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!	You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.	But you hate each other!
But you hate each other!	What's a little hate between business partners?
So, you've got it all figured, do you?	Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.	I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Whoever hired us.	I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.	Now that is an interesting proposition.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.	I don't have it with me...
I don't have it with me...	Bullshit!
Bullshit!	I swear...
I swear...	Then where is it?
Then where is it?	I sent it to myself in Paris.
I sent it to myself in Paris.	Sent it where?
Sent it where?	A post office box.
Is it done?	It's done.
Gregor, is that you?	Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.	It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.	I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!	So what do we do?
So what do we do?	What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
How so?	Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.	I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.	A means to an end, is that it?
A means to an end, is that it?	That's it.
That's it.	Then I guess we're set.
Then I guess we're set.	There is one other thing...
There is one other thing...	What's that?
What are you doing?	Don't cross me...
Don't cross me...	Nobody's going to do that!
Nobody's going to do that!	Really?
Really?	I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!	I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.	I do, I do...
Hello, Jean-Pierre.	Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.	And you respect him.
And you respect him.	Of course.  Don't you?
Of course.  Don't you?	I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?	Not exactly.
Not exactly.	Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?	How did you know?
How did you know?	If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
American.	Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?	No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?	Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.	Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.	You should really let a doctor look at that.
You should really let a doctor look at that.	Soon.
Soon.	But first you have something to take care of?
But first you have something to take care of?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?	It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.	Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
He sees this differently, as you well know.	I didn't expect that he would.
I didn't expect that he would.	You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.	Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?	Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
So this is what, a test?	Call it a reckoning of character.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.	Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
So what is it you want to know?	I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.	Created?
Created?	Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.	Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.	You seem one to me.
You seem one to me.	A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.	Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
You shoot alright.	Gets the job done.
Gets the job done.	All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.	Not for long.
Not for long.	Long enough to shoot back.
Long enough to shoot back.	Is that right?
Is that right?	It's been known to happen.
It's been known to happen.	Why don't you go do better, then...
Yeah, well...  My way works too.	My way is better.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.	Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?	Did he bring that with him?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.	What a surprise...
What a surprise...	I got a surprise for you, blondie...
They call me Swede.	Who's they?
Who's they?	Everybody.
You should watch what you eat.	Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?	I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.	And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?	Who you calling dumb, dickless?
I ride with fat-boy...	Eat shit and die slowly...
Eat shit and die slowly...	After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.	I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Where is this broad?	You should learn a little patience.
You should learn a little patience.	Is that right?
Is that right?	It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.	Not in mine.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.	I don't think so.
Sorry I'm late...	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?	Who else would you be?
Perhaps the police?	I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Cigarette?	No thanks.
He trusts you to lock up?	Let's just say he knows who I am.
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.	Coordinate what?
Coordinate what?	Things.  This is my country, you know.
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.
To see a man about a thing.	I can do that.
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
He says this is their block.	As in, they own it?
As in, they own it?	Something like that...
Something like that...	And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?	I didn't know that you spoke French.
I didn't know that you spoke French.	I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
What'd you say to him?	I asked if we could give him anything else.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?	Jujitsu.
Jujitsu.	Same thing, isn't it?
Same thing, isn't it?	Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.	What's the difference?
What's the difference?	One's a lot more painful than the other.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?	I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.	A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?	I do.
I do.	Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.	It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.	There is that.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.	Like Larry or Swede.
Like Larry or Swede.	Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?	Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.	Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.	So is the woman.
So is the woman.	Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.	I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.	I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?	I wanted to see who you were.
I wanted to see who you were.	Who am I?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.	That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.

Somebody's paying through the nose for this.	They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.	Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
Lovely, isn't it?	They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
I just wanted to see something.	See what?
I needed to know.	You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.	I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...

How did you know?	Know what?
Know what?	That there was a gun pointed at me.
That there was a gun pointed at me.	I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.	But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?	Because that's what I would have done...
The question still remains: what do we do now?	Gregor's cell phone...
What's going on?	You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I came up here to sneak a smoke.	You were smoking?
You were smoking?	I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.	Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
I borrowed that, too...	Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.	I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
It was at that.	A lot of people died.
A lot of people died.	I've seen a lot of people die before.
I've seen a lot of people die before.	I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?	You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.	I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.	We live in a singular world, my friend.
We live in a singular world, my friend.	I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.

To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.	You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
He's going back.	Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.	It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.	But you can't.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.	I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.	You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.	You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?	No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.	No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.	Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.	Not exactly.
Not exactly.	You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.	If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.	And what job is that?
And what job is that?	My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.	We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.	I'm going with you.
I'm going with you.	This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.	It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.	You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.	Yes I do.
Alright, it's done.	You see the bullet?
You see the bullet?	Clearly.
Clearly.	Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
You know him?	I know of him.
The Irish representative?	Yes.
What's this?	The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.	Thorough man.
You sure your friend got the right place?	If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?	Do what?
Do what?	Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.	It's my job.
It's my job.	Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.	Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.	It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.	Dark ops?
Dark ops?	Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.	Very ugly.
Very ugly.	It is at that.
It is at that.	Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.	I never made that claim.
I never made that claim.	I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.	You were behind the door?
You were behind the door?	I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.	You would have done that?
You would have done that?	I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.	How could you have done that?
How could you have done that?	Because I owe you.  Look at that...
They don't have the package.	You think?
You think?	You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
What the fuck happened?	I don't know...
I don't know...	You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Give me a cigarette.	Right now?
Right now?	Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!	Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?
Business keeps you on the road?	Something like that.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.	So I do it.
So I do it.	No you don't, and you know it.
No you don't, and you know it.	If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?	In a minute.
In a minute.	I think not.
Do we need anything else?	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Not here.  They might see it.	If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Time to quit.	Just like that?
Just like that?	Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.	What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.	Would you stop with that...
Would you stop with that...	Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.	The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.	Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.	Because I don't walk away.
Because I don't walk away.	Why not?
Why not?	It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?	Closest and oldest.
Closest and oldest.	And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.	And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?	That's a good question.
That's a good question.	Do you have a good answer?
Do you have a good answer?	No, I don't.
You have to stop doing that!	I'll work on it...
Let's get him out of here...	Finish the job...
Finish the job...	And now...
And now...	Finish it!
You son-of-a-bitch...	What?
What?	You speak French.
You speak French.	What of it?
What of it?	Nothing...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.	You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.	I know.
I know.	You better get some sleep, alright?
You better get some sleep, alright?	Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?	I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.	What happened to it?
What happened to it?	Gone.  Destroyed.
Gone.  Destroyed.	I guess that's for the best.
I told you, I quit.	Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
What's the story?	It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Gaelic.	You sure?
You sure?	I'm sure.
Why's that?	Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.	It's the Irish tape we want.
It's the Irish tape we want.	Gonna be tough.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.	Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
You slept with her!	How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with her!	You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...	You put everything on the line because you...
You put everything on the line because you...	You slept with the fucker!!
My man, how you doing?	I'm alright.  And you?
I'm alright.  And you?	Doing well.  This is?
Doing well.  This is?	A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.	Why don't we step into my office...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.	Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Do you have the tape?	I might know where you could get a copy.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.	You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?	All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
Can you get it?	The Russian would be easier.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.	I get the picture.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.	I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.	It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Sort of!	Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
What the hell happened here?	Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?	None of them had any --
Damn.	I want to get some hounds down here.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?	I can't get enough of it.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!	Dwayne listen to me -
Dwayne listen to me -	Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?	I don't know what you're -
I don't know what you're -	Don't lie to me!!!!
Ready to roll, partner?	Sure thing, and --
Don't spend it all in one place.	I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?	The horniest dog in Nevada.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.	Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.	I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.	I hear you.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.	Seven thousand...
Seven thousand...	He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.	Cash and what?
Cash and what?	Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...	Never heard of it.
Never heard of it.	Oh, you would have done great.
Oh, you would have done great.	I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.	That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
What the hell...	They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.	Shit, more than that.
What are we going to do?	What do you mean what are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?	I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Call it in I guess.  Why?	Why?  Are you kidding me?
No.  We can't.	Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.	We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?	Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!	We don't know that.
We don't know that.	Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!	Well someone's gonna find them.
Well someone's gonna find them.	Hell, it won't be us!
It won't work.	Why?
Why?	I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!	We'll figure something out.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!	Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.	Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?	It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?	I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!	What makes you so sure?
What makes you so sure?	Because...I know.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.	Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?	That's right!
That's right!	At the expense of six people.
At the expense of six people.	They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?	Maybe.  Who cares?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!	All right we will.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?	Torch it?!
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.	I don't know.
I've got one condition.	What's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.	Well, we won't do any of that shit!
Shhh!	What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?	Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?	He saw everything!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!	He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.	What are you thinking?
I don't know...	You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...	Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.	I...I can't do that.
I...I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.
Okay then.  I'll do it.	That's not what I mean.
That's not what I mean.	Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --	I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!	Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.	Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.	Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!	I don't know...
I don't know...	This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...	That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.	Well, we didn't know that at the time.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.	We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.	No we didn't.  He died on his own.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.	Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.	Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.	It's the right thing to do.
It's the right thing to do.	It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!	Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!	He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.	What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?	I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.	Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.	I can't do that.
I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.	Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.	He would have done it to us, right?
He would have done it to us, right?	Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!	All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!	Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.	Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.	I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.	And how do you figure we do that?
And how do you figure we do that?	All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.	He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.	Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's going to be trouble.	He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?	For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
You said that last time!	Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
You're out of your mind.	Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You think he's bluffing?	No.
No.	Neither do I.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...	If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!	Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.	I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.	Well what are we supposed to do?
Well what are we supposed to do?	I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
You're crazy.	How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?	Not bad enough to kill him.
Not bad enough to kill him.	Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!	I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
Here it is.	There it is...now what about the others?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!	You killed him...
You killed him...	It's gonna be o.k.
It's gonna be o.k.	Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...	We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!	You don't know if he was really gonna --
You don't know if he was really gonna --	Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Maybe we should say somethin'.	Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --	Do you have everything?
Do you have everything?	I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?	It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?	I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.	Then we're screwed.
Then we're screwed.	No we're not.
We're not?  How do you figure that?	We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.	We've got to go now, then.
We've got to go now, then.	That's right.
That's right.	Then Sally comes too.
Oh Jesus...	He killed her...he killed her...
He killed her...he killed her...	What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?	He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...	Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Booth, listen to me...Booth!	He killed her...
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!	No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.	What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
Dwayne's dead.	I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
What are you talking about?	Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
It's too late...	It's NOT too late!
It's NOT too late!	Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.	It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.	I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.	Uh huh.
Uh huh.	And you're solid on that?
And you're solid on that?	Rock solid.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.	Why don't you get to the point.
Why don't you get to the point.	My point, well...
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!	What's your offer, Jesse?
What's your offer, Jesse?	My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.	All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.	I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.	We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Well, I don't know...	That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.	How much?
How much?	I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?	Two thousand...
Two thousand...	By Friday.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.	What are you proposing?
What are you proposing?	I want my share. All of it.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!	None of us like it!
None of us like it!	Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.	Just take it in stride.
Just take it in stride.	I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.	No.  It's not.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?	You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!	Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!	You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!	Shut up, Jesse.
Shut up, Jesse.	HELLLLLP!!!!
Whoa, Earl!	OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!	What are you doing, Earl?
How are ya?	Hello.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?	No.  Why?
No.  Why?	Because someone may have gotten away.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?	Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.	You mean that guy was an agent?
You mean that guy was an agent?	Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.	What's that?
What's that?	Denning was wearing a bug.
Yeah?  So?	It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.	What for?
What for?	I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.	Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.	He's irresponsible.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.	Has he?
Has he?	No.  But he would, probably.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...	I might have to look into that...
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Heard you had quite a night.
Yeah.	It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.	I know.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Nothing.	Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.	Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?	OK.
OK.	Are you sure you're OK?
Are you sure you're OK?	Yeah I'm fine.
Yeah I'm fine.	I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?	OK.  I love you.
OK.  I love you.	I love you too.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.	I'm in here.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?	You deserve it is the occasion.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...	Nothing happened?
Nothing happened?	Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.	He's not, he's...
He's not, he's...	That son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch.	Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.	And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd take it out on him.	And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.	There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
You're worth every last penny.	Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.	How the hell did he find it?
How the hell did he find it?	He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.	Great...
Great...	It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.	Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.	Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.	I know.
I know.	Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.	He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.	It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?	I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...	I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.	We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...	It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
So do I.	I love you Sally.
I love you Sally.	I love you.
A satellite dish?	Well I was just throwing out ideas...
How are we going to do all this?	I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.	I don't know, Booth.
I don't know, Booth.	I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?	Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.	Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?	It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Why does that bother you?	I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...	Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?	I don't know.  My friends...
I don't know.  My friends...	We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.	Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...	Yeah, it is...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?	Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.	I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.	I swear to you, it's true...
Sally, do you love me?	You know I do.
Yeah, I've seen him.	What did he buy?
What did he buy?	I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.	Could it have been this?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...	A week ago, at most.
A week ago, at most.	Thanks for your time.
Test the product?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Sounds like you don't trust me.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?	You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?	You said that, I didn't.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?	What?
What?	I have a better plan.
And what's that?	How about you give us what you have and leave.
How about you give us what you have and leave.	What?
What?	Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...	First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.	Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.	Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Why?	Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
What makes you say that?	We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
I don't know.	This just might be our ticket!
What do you think about all this?	Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
I guess we can get started.	I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.	That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?	Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.	Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.	Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.	We appreciate that.
Uh, no...	Don't you think I would have told you that!
Maybe.  Maybe not.	What are you getting at?
What are you getting at?	Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.	Why would someone do that?
Why would someone do that?	Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.	Maybe I should come along.
Don't you have to be here?	Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.	Mm-hmm...
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.	Have you known this all along?
Have you known this all along?	Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.	Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Sheriff Hogan --	Dwayne.
Dwayne.	Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.	Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.	Did you say After Midnight?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.	Is this marked money, or what?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.	So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Yeah.	What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?	Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.	Lingerie...
Lingerie...	Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?	Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hello.	Hi.
Anything I can help you with?	Well I just uh, you know...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.	Anything...specific?
Anything...specific?	Well I don't know...
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!	We are having a sale on some items over here --
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.	Hmmm...
Hmmm...	I don't suppose you've seen her.
I don't suppose you've seen her.	Have I seen her?
Have I seen her?	Shopping here?
Shopping here?	No, I can't say that I have.
No, I can't say that I have.	Oh.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?	Uh...C?
Uh...C?	C?
C?	Yeah I'd say C...C.
Yeah I'd say C...C.	Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?	No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.	Sure.
Sure.	I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.	Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.	A lot of men come in here?
A lot of men come in here?	Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Just goes to show you.	I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Damn its hot in here...	He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.	All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?	No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.	Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!	Take it or leave it.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?	Sort of.
She's not his type.	Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Jesse?	Yeah whaddya want?.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?	Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?	Why?
Why?	Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.	About what?
About what?	Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.	Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.	So be here at three.
So be here at three.	I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.	I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.	Yeah...see you at three.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?	Well I'm here now.
Something wrong, Jesse?	No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?	You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.	Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
What's this?	I don't know...
Hey where's the hot pad?	What?
What?	Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?	I can't hear a word you're saying!
I can't hear a word you're saying!	Forget it.
It was going to be a surprise!	A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
What are you saying?	I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.	Watch that.  Watch that tone.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?	Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.	That hasn't stopped you before.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.	I didn't say that.  You did.
I didn't say that.  You did.	Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...	Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Don't you want to hear about my day?	Yeah let's hear about your day.
Yeah let's hear about your day.	Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Whatever...	Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!	Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.	It certainly is...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!	Dwayne put the gun down --
Dwayne put the gun down --	Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
You'd do this to me?!	Dwayne -
Dwayne -	You'd do this to me!
Dwayne please calm down!	Calm down --
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.	Then what the hell are you all about?
I'll settle for a third of that.	And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?	True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
We're out of here.	Right behind you.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.	What?
What?	Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
I'm not asking.	Well you're not getting, either.
Well you're not getting, either.	Listen -
What do you mean?  You gambled it?	I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.	Oh Jesus Christ...
Oh Jesus Christ...	So I want the money and I want it now.
So I want the money and I want it now.	Well you can't have it.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.	You're never getting that much.
You're never getting that much.	I think I am.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --	We're gonna talk.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.	Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Don't hurt me.	We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.	Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi ma.	Hi.
I didn't know you were coming.	I was in the neighborhood.
I was in the neighborhood.	Is that the mail?
Is that the mail?	Yeah.
How's work?	Well, same ol' same ol'.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.	It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.	Did they ever find out who they were?
Did they ever find out who they were?	Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.	I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.	At least around here it does.
At least around here it does.	Are you hungry?
Are you hungry?	Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.	You do?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...	And what happened?
And what happened?	Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.	And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.	That's great Earl!
That's great Earl!	Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
This whole place?	Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Don't you want it?	Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.	Well I don't know --
Well I don't know --	You've done without it long enough, ma.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?	Absolutely positively.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?	Give me the bad news.
Give me the bad news.	We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.	Anything in it?
Anything in it?	Money.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.	There was more than that.
There was more than that.	Not in the trunk.
Not in the trunk.	That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?	Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.	So...what's the good news?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.	So someone did get away.
So someone did get away.	I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.	No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?	We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.	I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!	You think he skipped town?
You think he skipped town?	We're going to find out.
Yeah.	What do you think?  Heart attack?
This isn't right...	I'm not getting an answer.
I'm not getting an answer.	Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?	Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?	It's nine-thirty in the morning.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.	Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.	Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.	Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.	I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?	Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.	No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?	Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
What the hell is that?	Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.	Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?	No, I just assumed...
No, I just assumed...	You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?	No, sir.
No, sir.	Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
Winner six!	How much is that?
How much is that?	Two-hundred thousand!
Two-hundred thousand!	Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Winner!  Four, winner!	I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
Invitation, please.	I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.	The band has been playing over an hour.
The band has been playing over an hour.	I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Wait.	Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?	Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.	What??  Where'd you hear that?
What??  Where'd you hear that?	I got my sources.
I got my sources.	And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.	James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?	Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.	Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.	I'd like to see you try.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.	Is this about the funny money?
Is this about the funny money?	How'd you know?
How'd you know?	You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.	So tell me what you know.
So tell me what you know.	I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?	Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
What?	One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.	All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.	Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.	San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.	This is your ship?

That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.	El Capitan?
El Capitan?	I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.	Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?	Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.	The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."	Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?	I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.	Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.	I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.	How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Yeah, that's right.	We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.	Look, I've been working this case for months now...
Look, I've been working this case for months now...	So what's your story?
So what's your story?	They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.	It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.	How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?	In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.	What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?	The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I'm busy at the moment.	I said get on your feet!
I said get on your feet!	I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?	I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.	I don't think so...
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.	It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.	That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?	I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?	Lee, you okay?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?	C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh, you American?	That's right.
That's right.	You bring American money?
You bring American money?	Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?	No.  It's my first time.
No.  It's my first time.	You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.	Oh yes, she's very nice.
Oh yes, she's very nice.	She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?	I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.	Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.	Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...	Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?	You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.	You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.	That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.	Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.

You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.	I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.	Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.	Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?	Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.	Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.	Carter, would I lie to you?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?	No.
No.	You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?	No.
No.	Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.	Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?	Bathroom.
Carter, get off that stage!	Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.	I knew you were lying.
I knew you were lying.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.	No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.	Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?	Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.	Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.

No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.	You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
What'd I say?	You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.	Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.	Try to land on your feet.
You lied to me.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.	No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.	This won't take long.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!	Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.	I am a tourist.
Hello.	How you doin'?
How you doin'?	My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What are you doing?	She said I could pick any girl I want.
She said I could pick any girl I want.	Well, hurry up.
Well, hurry up.	Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
What's wrong?	Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.	I'm calling for back up!
Goddamn you got a small ass.	Don't look at my ass!
Where are you going?	Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.	Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.	Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.	Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!	My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!	It's my job!

Good at what?	Forget it.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.	Ask me if I give a shit.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.	How the hell did Tan get away with it?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?	All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.	This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
No, no, that would be crazy --	You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...	I thought you'd think it was crazy.

You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.	Why LA?
Why LA?	I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...	Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.	Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the Rich White Man?	Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.	Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Follow the RichWhiteMan...	Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.	Who?

Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.	How do you know he's our man?
How do you know he's our man?	Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

He'll be back soon.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.	Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.	The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.

I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?	It's a long story.

No.  It was my singing.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.	Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.	I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

What is it?	No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
I don't understand?	She's walking back towards the door.
Pick it up!	It's your turn!
It's your turn!	I don't need a turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!	There's people up here!
There's people up here!	Get it out of here!
Get it out of here!	Take it!
I wouldn't do that!!!	It's a bomb.
Let me see it again?	We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.	We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.	They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.

Are you okay?	What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.	She saved our lives.
She saved our lives.	For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.	Shhh, my head hurts.
Shhh, my head hurts.	I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.

Steamed dumplings?	Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.	That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.	Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?	That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?	They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.	Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

End of the line.	You've been a good friend, James Carter.

Vegas...	Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Red Dragon.	That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Let's go.	Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.	What is Mac out?
What is Mac out?	Follow me my Asian brother.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.	Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.	Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.	Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.	Wait here.  I'll handle this.

Dancing?	Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?	It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!	No.  I'm going to find out.
No.  I'm going to find out.	Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.	Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.	I'll give it my best shot.
Lee!	MMMMMM!!!!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?	I did!
I did!	No you didn't!
No you didn't!	Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
Ricky Tan is alive.	What?!?!
What?!?!	We have to get to the Penthouse.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.	Carter...
Carter...	Just GO!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.	It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.	No problem.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.	She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
That your gate down there?	Yes.
Yes.	I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.	I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.	You take care of yourself, Lee.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.	It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
What is this?	About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.	No, Carter.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.	It's okay, I got lots more.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.	This money is evidence.
This money is evidence.	Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.	New York City?
New York City?	First class.
First class.	The Plaza Hotel?
The Plaza Hotel?	A little Mu-shu.
A little Mu-shu.	Some Kung-Pao?
I could use a little vacation.	Amen to that, brother.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.	What "revenge" is he talking about?
What "revenge" is he talking about?	I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?	Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --	Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.	Fine with me.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.	Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Is this a payoff?	No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.	And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.	Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Put your arms around me.	Excuse me?
What's going on?	I need your help.
I need your help.	Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.	I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
You move well.	Just trying to make it look real.
Just trying to make it look real.	Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.	Why don't you go get them?
Why don't you go get them?	If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.	How do I know I can trust you?
How do I know I can trust you?	Dip me!
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?	No.  But I'll help you.
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.	Now you know.
Master Ching taught me.	The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?	No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?	Baby Duck?
Baby Duck?	That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Do you still have the bills?	I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.	Any leads?
Any leads?	We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.	It's my responsibility.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.	The Secret Service?  Why?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.	Are you okay, Lee?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...	Did you tell Sterling?
Did you tell Sterling?	Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.	Thank you.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --	I'll take him.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.	You must come with me for questioning.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --	Don't.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.	The police can protect you.
The police can protect you.	Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.	Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.	There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.	Put the plates down.  It's over.
Put the plates down.  It's over.	I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?	Yes, Master.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.	Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.	Ricky Tan?
Ricky Tan?	No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.	I know, Master, but...

That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.	Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!	Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
You know what a phone booth is?!	The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Lee!  It's him!	The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.

That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.	Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.	Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!	Shut up!
Shut up!	OK. Say what it is.
OK. Say what it is.	The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.	Sir, I can explain.
Sir, I can explain.	What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.	I know, but --
I know, but --	That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
Good job.	Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.	I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Feds asked for me?	They asked for the best street man I had.
And that, of course, would be me.	Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.	Carter.
He stole my wheel!	This is pathetic.
This is pathetic.	I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.	Tell me about it.
Tell me about it.	He was just doing his job.
He was just doing his job.	So was I.
You talk very fast.	Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy.	You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!	Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Help me Rhonda.	Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
You have one of these?	No.
No.	Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
You speak English!	A little.
A little.	Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.	I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.	It's the same thing!
It's the same thing!	I am not responsible for your assumptions.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.	You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?	Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.	Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.	We are both full of shit.
We are both full of shit.	Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.	Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
-- what the hell is that?	What?
What?	That silly-ass look on your face.
That silly-ass look on your face.	I was being polite.
I was being polite.	Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Where were we?	Witnesses.
Witnesses.	Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.	Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.	It was not my intent --
It was not my intent --	Right....
Right....	Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.	Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
What about them?	I know a shortcut.
I know a shortcut.	Shortcut?
Shortcut?	You don't know what a shortcut is?
You make the plate?	What plate?
What plate?	The license!  You get it?!
The license!  You get it?!	No.
No.	What the hell kinda cop are you?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!	Did you make the plate?!
Did you make the plate?!	It was my ass that almost got trashed!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!	He was trying to kill me, not you.
He was trying to kill me, not you.	Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?	It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.	Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.	What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?	No. I just made it up.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.	Don't go there...
Don't go there...	I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.	Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.	I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.	Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?	Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?	Stooly.
Stooly.	What?
What?	Stool pigeon.
Stool pigeon.	Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
You talk too fast.	Come on!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?	Took off. Yes. They took off.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.	Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.	It happens.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.	That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.	Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.	Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
You like it?	Yeah, it's good.
Yeah, it's good.	That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
You want more?	No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
Now, that's American music.	Yes, I know this song.
Yes, I know this song.	You know War?
You know War?	Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
That's not how it goes.	Yes, I think so.
Yes, I think so.	No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!	Yee-aww.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.	Good God, ya'll!
Good God, ya'll!	No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Are you OK?	I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
Want some?	No, fish is a PM food.
No, fish is a PM food.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
What?!	It's him.
Which one?	Going into the restaurant.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.	This concrete?  This is still America.
This concrete?  This is still America.	What do you hear?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.	I am from outa town.
I am from outa town.	No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Like that.	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, please, I don't --	It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.	Oh yes.
Oh no, I dropped it.	You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lee.	Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?	Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh no.	What?
What?	The art.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...	Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh my god. Griffin.	You know him?
What a surprise!	FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.	It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.	No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?	Oh, I think you like this very much.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?	Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Not anymore.	Where'd you get it?
You're killin' me here.	Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.	Oh, baby, you cruel...
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --	Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.	The Feds?!
The Feds?!	FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?	No...what?
No...what?	I could get promoted right out of here.
I could get promoted right out of here.	What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?	I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
How'd what go?	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.	They put you in charge?
They put you in charge?	In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.	Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?	Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.	OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.	No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
You got a lot of guts calling me.	Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.	You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!	Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Jesus...what do you want?	This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?	This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.	Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Oh my god...what happened to you?	It's called a dress.
It's called a dress.	It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.	What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.	Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.	That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You don't like it?	It's okay. For restaurants.
You OK?	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?	Yeah. So why you look do down?
Yeah. So why you look do down?	Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.	Not to me. Never to me.
How about a lift home?	Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Any demands yet?	At this point we don't have much.
At this point we don't have much.	How much they want?
How much they want?	You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.	Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.	Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...	He is the situation.
I'm talking about the girl.	Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What kind of assignment is that?	Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.	Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?	Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.	What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?	Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!	Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
You understand what I'm sayin'?	Carter, shut up!
Yo, Johnson...	You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!	Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!	That's what you were supposed to be!
Hmmmm?	Don't play bullshit games with me.
Don't play bullshit games with me.	Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?	Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?	No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...	I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.	What?!
What?!	And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...	Shut up!
Shut up!	You a cop or something?
You a cop or something?	Or somethin'.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.	I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.	I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.	Nobody touches me.
Nobody touches me.	Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.	What are you talking about?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?	I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?	Do it!
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.	How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!	All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
You sonuvabitch.	I'm waitin' here for a name.
Where do we find him?	You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Hello.	Ambassador Han.
Ambassador Han.	Yes.
Yes.	Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
My daughter.	She's fine.
She's fine.	Can I speak with her?
Yes.	You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.	Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Hello.	Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.	I want to speak with my daughter!
Hello.	Han?
Han?	Yes.
Yes.	It's Griffin.
It's Griffin.	Griffin?  Where are you.
Yes.	You have what I asked for?
You have what I asked for?	I do.
I do.	Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I would like one of my people to help.	Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.	He is very good.
He is very good.	As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.	I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...	He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.	Carter, can I have a moment?
I am so sorry about your men.	Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.	And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?	Don't worry, he's with Carter.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?	I still have work to do here.
I still have work to do here.	I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.	I was trying to find the right time.
I was trying to find the right time.	After I left?
I will not have friends in America.	Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
What is he up to now?	Ike just came by to check out the team.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?	I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?	Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.	You don't understand this guy.
You don't understand this guy.	Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."	I'm not running.
I'm not running.	So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.	I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Right.	I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Yes.	Let me take you back inside, okay?
Ahh.	I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
See you at the wedding.	You bet ya, Coach.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.	Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What do you expect me to say to this?	How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
You look awful.	Thank you.
Really?	I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.	Got any last minute advice?
Got any last minute advice?	Maintain eye contact.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.	What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?	Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.	What did he ask?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...	And what did you say?
And what did you say?	How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?	Good one!  Thanks.
Good one!  Thanks.	It happens to be how I feel.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.	God bless you, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.	Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.	I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?	Of course.
Of course.	Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?	Of course.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.	Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
And in a "V".	Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
We do it to our dog.	It's hurting.
It's hurting.	We'll rub.
I'll get the dress.	He's here!... He's here!
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.	Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Bob's in a hurry.	Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."	"Sink the putt."
"Sink the putt."	"Make the shot."
"Make the shot."	"Nothing but net."
"Nothing but net."	"Never say die."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.	His hair... any color.
Rub your ears.	Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.	I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.	So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
-- It's for you, Ike.	What?
What?	Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.	That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.	I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.	Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
No, that's what makes you unemployed.	I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.	I already made an appointment for later today.
I already made an appointment for later today.	See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?	I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Fisher, let him talk.	But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?	No.  No, you didn't.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.	I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Maggie!	Where do you think she's going?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.	... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?	Or a vegetarian?
Or a vegetarian?	Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's running after her.	Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.	Poor Ike.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.	Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
In vino veritas.	Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...	What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.	The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.	All the gory details.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.	It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.	This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.	Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.	Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.	"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.	Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.	But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...	Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.	This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?	No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?	I don't know.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.	You're coming here?
You're coming here?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Then come for dinner.
Then come for dinner.	Okay, we'll order out.
Okay, we'll order out.	Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...	Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Of course we are.  Of course.	Then you'll be my best man.
Then you'll be my best man.	Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.	Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
I have no idea what I'm doing.	Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!	I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Get this man a Kamikaze.	Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.	And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.	Thanks.
Thanks.	She's a cacophony of contradictions.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.	Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.	Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.	Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?	Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.	Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."	I don't think that's why she ran.
I don't think that's why she ran.	Why do YOU think she ran?
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.	And you defending her?
And you defending her?	No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.	Unbelievable, she got to you.
Unbelievable, she got to you.	Oh, please!
Sorry, no.  I just got one.	Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.	Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.	It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.	I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.	Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.	Oh, I will.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.	Tootaloo.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.	No, I'm not.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...	Are you a reporter?
What?	It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.	About her upcoming wedding and all.
About her upcoming wedding and all.	No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?	Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
And you are?	Looking for Maggie.
Looking for Maggie.	Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
I think you'd look good in red.	No, she's talking about your hair.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?	Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.	This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.	That must have made you proud.
It's nice that they're still friends.	Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Yes, I am.  And who are you?	Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.	Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --	-- The luau for Maggie.
Your two cinnamon rolls.	Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
They made me put my hat back on.	Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?	Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.	You know, your daughter seems...
Like her mother.	Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...	Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.	Originality is my speciality.
Originality is my speciality.	Excellent.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.	You'll answer my questions?
Getting nervous?	Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?	Yes.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...	You have one?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?	Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.	You're going to be very disappointed.
You're going to be very disappointed.	We'll see.
We'll see.	I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
That's fair.	Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Everest.  Is that right?	Twice...
Twice...	Really?
Really?	Without oxygen...
How romantic.	We think so.
We think so.	Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.	A pre-wedding luau?
Give me that!	But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.	He is not!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?	You can turn that finger around.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.	Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.	How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.	I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.	Really.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.	Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.	You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?	Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Too much.	Seven-fifty.
Seven-fifty.	Five hundred.
Five hundred.	Six-fifty.
Six-fifty.	Done.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.	Cindy the manicurist.
I think so.	I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.	Maybe someday.
Maybe someday.	You afraid to try?
You afraid to try?	No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.	Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.	What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Always a mood killer.	Still sweet.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.	He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.	Highly suspect.
Highly suspect.	What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!	Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
I'm a work in progress.	So?  Is that what you said to her?
So?  Is that what you said to her?	No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"	Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I don't know.	You don't know.
You don't know.	No.
No.	Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.	Agreed.
You look... uh... You look fine.	Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.	Bob will be very happy.
I'll have the same.	Of course.
Of course.	What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?	You know, there's no...
Ike... Hi, Grandma.	Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?	It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.	It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.	No.  You take it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?	No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.	Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.	Can you fix it?
Can you fix it?	First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.	Of what?
Of what?	Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Kind of isolated.	Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.	Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Where did you disappear to?	Missed me bad, huh?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?	Yes.
Yes.	I don't and I don't think you should...
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.	You humiliated me!
You humiliated me!	No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.	I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.	Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
It's fun!  It's high.	Or the sexual habits of locusts?
Or the sexual habits of locusts?	That was very interesting research George was doing!
That was very interesting research George was doing!	What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?	I already explained about that.
I already explained about that.	And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?	Brian told you that?
Brian told you that?	Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.	Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.	Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.	Lost!
Lost!	That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.	What!?
What!?	With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.	That's called changing your mind.
That's called changing your mind.	No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.	Yes I do!
Yes I do!	No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.	I'd rather not.
I'd rather not.	Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.	I kissed him back.
About a minute...?	A little longer for me.
A little longer for me.	Really?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?	I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.	Me, either.
I love you.  I love you.	I love you, too.
To who?  Are you asking me?	Me?
Yes, you!	Well, you do have the dress.
Well, you do have the dress.	And the church.
And the church.	And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.	I'm okay with that.
I'm okay with that.	So am I.
So am I.	So, we'll...
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?	I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.	It's something I've always wanted to do.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?	I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
Does it matter?	I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.

So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.	Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.	I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Used?	They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.	This is getting serious.
You were not.	I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?	I'm listening.
I'm listening.	"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Pretty good speech, Maggie.	I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?	Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
You're a goddess!	I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.	Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Reporter?	Yup!
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.	She's the boss.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.	For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?	That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.	It's probably because you got him fired.
It's probably because you got him fired.	Ya think?
Ya think?	Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.	Where?
Where?	Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.	He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.	Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?	Yes.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.	On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I'm going to kill myself.	Why?
Why?	Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".	No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.	But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!	No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.	But I'm weird.
But I'm weird.	No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.	Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.	I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?	Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.	It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.	Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, wahine.	Lighten up, what?
Lighten up, what?	This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.	I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.	Would it?
He's going to be the pastor?	Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.	What happened at the luau?
What happened at the luau?	... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?	It's for the bell.
Grandma!	See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.	No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".	You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.	Not eight...
Let's go.	No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
You okay?  I'm closing.	I'm just finishing up, too.
I'm just finishing up, too.	Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?	No, I'm just going to head home.
No, I'm just going to head home.	Okay.
What are you talking about?	Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.	Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Thank you.  You still think that he was....	Quick.  Very quick.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.	Not this one.  This one's on me.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.	Good boy, Port Hole.
Good boy, Port Hole.	His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.	I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
I'm really rooting for this one.	Thank you, Dad.
What?	Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.	Maggie, it's just a joke...
Maggie, it's just a joke...	No.  It's my life.
No.  It's my life.	A harmless joke.
A harmless joke.	No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.	"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
You tell Maggie.	No, you tell her.
No, you tell her.	No, no.  You're her best friend.
No, no.  You're her best friend.	No.
No.	You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.	Is there somebody else?
Is there somebody else?	Nope.
Nope.	You don't love me, is that it?
You don't love me, is that it?	Nope.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.	That's good.
You take the microwave?	What am I going to do with a microwave?
What am I going to do with a microwave?	You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.	So you're angry.  Big deal.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.	He's got a houseboat.
He's got a houseboat.	I hate boats.
I hate boats.	It sounds nice.
It sounds nice.	Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.	Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.	Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.	It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.	But it's on the water.
But it's on the water.	It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.

If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --	My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Is that all right with you?	Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.	I love you.
I love you.	I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?	Nope.
Nope.	Even when you were young?
Even when you were young?	Nope.  Not even when I was young.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?	How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.	I'll wait.
I'll wait.	Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year, darling.	Happy New Year.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?	Walter, I'd love to --
Walter, I'd love to --	We'll stay at the Plaza --
We'll stay at the Plaza --	Go for a walk in Central Park --
Go for a walk in Central Park --	Go to the Symphony --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.	What is it?
What is it?	It's delicious, trust me.
It's delicious, trust me.	Does it have wheat in it?
Does it have wheat in it?	I don't think so.
Who is it?	Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.	I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.	That doesn't make any sense.
That doesn't make any sense.	I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?	Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.	When you get back, I'll be gone --
When you get back, I'll be gone --	And then I'll see you in New York --
And then I'll see you in New York --	Okay, okay.
You go.	Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.	I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?	What?
What?	About forever.
About forever.	No.
No.	Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.	You couldn't.
You couldn't.	I do.
I do.	It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter.	It was my mother's.
It was my mother's.	It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Beautiful view, isn't it?	Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --	-- it was a betrayal.
-- it was a betrayal.	Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...	So what happened?
So what happened?	I told you.  Nothing --
I told you.  Nothing --	At the top of the Empire State Building --
At the top of the Empire State Building --	I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.	Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.	I think that's what I'm saying.
You okay?	Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Oh!	What?
What?	Look!
You should write something about this.	About what?
About what?	Whatever it is.
It's not true, but it feels true.	There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What was that about up there?	What was what?
What was what?	What's with you?
What's with you?	Nothing's with me.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?	That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.	And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.

"Dear Sleepless and Son..."	It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --	"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.	I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.

You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?	I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.	Right.
Right.	I should say something in this about magic.
I should say something in this about magic.	What?
What?	I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?	Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.	"I want to meet you..."
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."	Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 	You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.	He lost all the weight... there.
He lost all the weight... there.	That's impossible.  A guy can't --
That's impossible.  A guy can't --	Can too.
Can too.	No.
No.	Yes.
Yes.	And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?	Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.	Listen to this, I love this part --
Men never get this movie.	I know.
I know.	Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?	I always wondered about that too.
Hello.	Turn on your radio!
Turn on your radio!	What?
What?	The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.	Definitely.
Did you talk to him?	I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.	That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.	Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.	Becky?
Becky?	What?
What?	Is this crazy?
Is this crazy?	No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.	Thank you.  I love you.
Thank you.  I love you.	I love you, too.
I love you, too.	Good night.
You were standing in the middle of the street?	You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?

I love that dream.	That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.	But he saw you, right?
But he saw you, right?	He said hello.
It's a sign --	It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
You don't know who she was, Annie --	I saw her.  She looked just like this --
This is a photo of hair.	Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Becky?	So I mailed your letter.
So I mailed your letter.	"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."	M.F.E.O.?
M.F.E.O.?	Made for each other.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.	I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.	What about the letter?
What about the letter?	It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
You're going to miss the train.	No, I'm not. 
No, I'm not. 	What are your plans in New York?
What are your plans in New York?	We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.	I love the symphony.
I love the symphony.	I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...	Okay.
Okay.	She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.

No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.	You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --

Go home for the weekend.	That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.	And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Please --	This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --	How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.	Come on, Jonah --
Are you Annie?	Yes.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.	Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?	Howard.
Howard.	Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?	What?
What?	I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --	I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.	But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?	Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.

It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.	I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?	Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.	Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.	Any time.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --	Walter and I are engaged!
It's probably just the flowers --	We'll move them --

You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.	How did it happen?
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.	How amazing.
How amazing.	It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.

Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.	Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?	It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.	What?
What?	You know.
You know.	What?
What?	Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.  It was magic.	Magic.
Magic.	I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --	Mom!
Mom!	Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --	Mom, we already...
Mom, we already...	Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?	Like... clockwork.
So you'll get married in a new dress.	It's a sign.
It's a sign.	You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do.	Sure you do --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...	Magic.
Magic.	Magic.
Hello.	Hello.
Hi.	Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?	Shhhh --
It's you.	It's me?
It's me?	The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Which means --	The cabinets have to be redone --
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?	Grace heard it.
Grace heard it.	Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.	The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.	Why me? What about Jay?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.	Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello.	Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.	I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.	Who is this?
Who is this?	Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.	Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.	I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
All righ...	Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?	It's been about a year and a half.
It's been about a year and a half.	Have you had any relationship since?
Have you had any relationship since?	No.
Why not?	Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --	And I don't want to invade your privacy --
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...	What's she talking about?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?	It's hard to imagine.
What are you going to do, Sam?	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
What was it that made you know?	I don't think I could really describe it.
I don't think I could really describe it.	Why not?
Why not?	And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?	It's not that late in Seattle.
It's not that late in Seattle.	Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?	It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
You don't like the one he was now?	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.	Where's your mom?
Where's your mom?	She died.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.	I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.	And you're worried about him.
And you're worried about him.	I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
No.	Why not?
Why not?	It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.	You want me to talk to him?
Is he home right now?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.	I don't know --
I don't know --	I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.	Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.	Fair enough.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.	Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.	What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.	How about rapacious and love- starved?
How about rapacious and love- starved?	No.
No.	It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --	It is not --
It is not --	Right, right.
Hey, my plate is full.	Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --	I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.	And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.	You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?	Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
When's the latest time you were out there?	Seventy... eight.
Seventy... eight.	Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.	I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.	Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.	What's tira misu?
What's tira misu?	You'll find out.
You'll find out.	What is it?
What is it?	You'll see.
You'll see.	Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.	You'll like it.
You'll like it.	This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Dad, could you close the door?	H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Write her.	You think so?
You think so?	It's Y. O. H.
It's Y. O. H.	Yeah.  What's that?
Yeah.  What's that?	Your only hope.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.	I don't get it.
I don't get it.	You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?	Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?	Eighty dollars.
Eighty dollars.	I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.	But how am I going to get there?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?	Window.
Window.	Do you want a fruit plate?
Do you want a fruit plate?	I don't know.  Do I?
I don't know.  Do I?	I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
Dad --	What is it?
What is it?	There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.	I don't think I have to now.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --	It's a spice rack.
It's a spice rack.	We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
Dad?  About last night?	It's never happening again. Right?
It's never happening again. Right?	Right.
Not.	My feelings exactly.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?	It plays in 50 states.
It plays in 50 states.	What?!
What?!	Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.	You're right.  You better hope so.
Dad, I don't know about this one --	Oh, you're changing your mind --
Oh, you're changing your mind --	No, I'm not, but --
No, I'm not, but --	What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?	Dad --
Does red pepper go under R or P?	P.  Dad?
P.  Dad?	What?
What?	I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --	Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?	Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Fine.  Fine.	So I can go.
So I can go.	Sure.  Looking good.
Sure.  Looking good.	Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?	I think I know how to have a spice rack.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --	Stressed.
Stressed.	Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?	They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
How did they get our phone number?	You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?	Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.	This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --	Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?	Somewhere in the middle.
Somewhere in the middle.	I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --	She's willing to fly anywhere.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!	Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.	This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?	English muffin.  How do you do it?
English muffin.  How do you do it?	You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --	-- a slice of pizza --
-- a slice of pizza --	But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.	It doesn't.  They ask you.
It doesn't.  They ask you.	I'm starting to notice that.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?	What do you think?
What do you think?	Will she scratch up your back?
Will she scratch up your back?	What?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.	Whose show was this on?
Whose show was this on?	Jed's got cables.
Jed's got cables.	Go to sleep.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.	It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.	Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."	I know.
I know.	How do you know?
It was sinking.	What was?
What was?	Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.	You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.	Bye bye blackbird.
Bye bye blackbird.	Is that what she used to sing?
Is that what she used to sing?	I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Like do you believe in heaven?
Like do you believe in heaven?	I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?	I'm starting to forget her.
I'm starting to forget her.	I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.	Good.
This one's for both of us.	Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Great.	I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 	This is a good letter, Dad.
This is a good letter, Dad.	The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.	Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.	Now I'm late.  Bye.
Listen to this --	Not now, Jonah --
Not now, Jonah --	Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"	Jonah, I'm leaving --
Jonah, I'm leaving --	WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Dad!	Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.	It's a sign.
It's a sign.	Oh, right.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 	She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.	Perfect.  We'll be there.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --	There she is.
Why is she bringing that bag?	She's going to cook something for us?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.	It's only ten o'clock.
It's only ten o'clock.	Jonah!
Jonah!	Okay.
Okay.	Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thank Victoria for dinner.	Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.	I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
Don't ever do that again.	I thought I saw a black widow spider.
What are you doing up?	I was thirsty.
I was thirsty.	There's a bathroom upstairs.
There's a bathroom upstairs.	The water tastes better in the kitchen.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.	That's true.  Why is that?
Did you call that radio station again?	No.
No.	Everyone at work heard you.
Everyone at work heard you.	I just called for a second.
I just called for a second.	Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.	It's a short word.
It's a short word.	This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.	If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.	Was Mom an adjustment?
Was Mom an adjustment?	I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
God, she's beautiful.	Victoria? She's okay.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.	Who is Annie?
Who is Annie?	The one who wrote us.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.	I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Have you seen my wallet?	It might be in the kitchen.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.	Are you going with her?
Are you going with her?	Yes.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --	This is the one I like.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.	Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.	What's wrong with Annie?
What's wrong with Annie?	Shut up.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.	This conversation is finished.
This conversation is finished.	You said we could go to New York.
You said we could go to New York.	Did not.
Did not.	Did too.
Did too.	I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.	I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.	Get out.
Get out.	No.
No.	Goddammit, I am sick of this --
What if I couldn't get to you?	I was scared of what you were gonna do.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.	When I found you?
When I found you?	If I didn't go.
If I didn't go.	Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?	No.
No.	I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?	No.
I can't believe you flew first class.	It was all they had.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.	Okay.
Okay.	What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?	Sure.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.	Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Do you like baseball?	Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?	What about camping?
What about camping?	What about it?
What about it?	Do you like it?
Do you like it?	I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.	We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.	Well...
Well...	I think they're announcing your flight.
Hi.	Hi.  Sam?
Hi.  Sam?	Yes?
Yes?	You must be Jonah.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.	Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.	Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?	Microwave.  Five minutes.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.	Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.	I'm sorry --
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?	He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You saw her in the airport and then here?	I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
How's Jonah taking it?	It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --	You're kidding --
You're kidding --	Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
It's a little derivative.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
Anyway, Victoria's nice.	Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?	Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Hi.	Hi.
You look good.	You look good yourself.
I thought you were never going to call me.	You did?
You did?	I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --	You could have called me --
You could have called me --	No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...	You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.	Oh.
Oh.	So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --	I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --	I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
Is he there?	No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.	Absolutely.  Right.
He's ten.	He's good at it.
He's good at it.	I read an article about this ...
I read an article about this ...	I read the same article...
I read the same article...	It takes time --
It takes time --	Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?	Sure.  Sure.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!	Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Why didn't you give a warning signal?	Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?	Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?	You're welcome to one.
You're welcome to one.	No thanks.
No thanks.	The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.	That's none of their affair.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?	No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?	There's nothing stopping you.
Mornin'.	How's it going?
How's it going?	Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.	Whose side are you on anyway?
Whose side are you on anyway?	Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Well?	I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.	You haven't tried locking them up!
You haven't tried locking them up!	You want 'em all arrested?
You want 'em all arrested?	No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
Got any more ideas?	I don't make policy.
Take a drink. Calm down!	I say we gotta take action. Now.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?	It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.	No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?	You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
How goes it?	It never ends.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.	Yeah.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.	The woman question?
The woman question?	Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.	So? What does he want to do about 'em?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?	He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.	What do you mean -- sex equality?
What do you mean -- sex equality?	You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?	You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.	Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.	So much the better.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.	He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.	You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.	Who? A scab?
Who? A scab?	An American.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.	You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...	You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Are you sick, Mama?	No, Estellita.
No, Estellita.	Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?	Later. When I finish the ironing.
Mama, can I put the candles ...	Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Why are they singing, Mama?	They are singing for me.
They are singing for me.	Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?	Yes. We will light the candles.
To the mine?	Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.	No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.	Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.	Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.	With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.	It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen	I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Where you going?	Got to talk to the brothers.
This water's cold again.	I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Forget it.	Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.	Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.	What?
What?	We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.	What's more important than sanitation?
What's more important than sanitation?	The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.	I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.	Now don't start talking against the union again.
Now don't start talking against the union again.	What has it got me, your union?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!	All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...	Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?	If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!	Never... never... never!
Never... never... never!	Aaah, what's the use?
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?	I'm a fool.
I'm a fool.	No, no ...
Was it expensive, the beer?	Antonio paid for it.
Antonio paid for it.	Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.	I did forget. Lus told me.
What's the matter?	It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Mother of God ...have mercy ...	Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
A fighter, huh?	He was born fighting. And born hungry.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.	Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.	He'll have it good. Some day.
What were they saying? About you? In there?	They say I am no good to you.
They say I am no good to you.	You are no good to me -- in jail.
You are no good to me -- in jail.	I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.	What makes you so sure?
What makes you so sure?	Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Let them take it!	Over my dead body.
Over my dead body.	I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.	But it's yours. I won't let them ...
But it's yours. I won't let them ...	Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.	No.
No.	But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...	The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.	Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.	She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.	NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.	There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.	Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.	Can be what?
Can be what?	Backward.
You all right?	Sure.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?	Yes.
Yes.	I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?	I'm going back tomorrow.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!	I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.	Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
How do you feel?	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.	Four nights. How did you sleep?
Four nights. How did you sleep?	We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?	No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.	No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.	A meeting?
A meeting?	Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
I waited up till midnight.	You weren't waiting for me.
You weren't waiting for me.	That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?	Be still ...
Be still ...	But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Tell me.	We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.	No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Where are you going?	Hunting.
Hunting.	When?
When?	Sun up.
Sun up.	Alone?
Alone?	No.
No.	Ramn -- you can't.
Ramn -- you can't.	Why not? I'm not needed here.
Why not? I'm not needed here.	But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.	Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.	Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.	And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?	It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.	Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.	You mean you're ready to give up?
You mean you're ready to give up?	Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.	Like what?
Like what?	I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...	Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!	Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?	I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.	No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?	You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?	Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?	Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...	Will you be still?
Will you be still?	And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
This is what we've been waiting for.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.	But honey ...
But honey ...	Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.	Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.	Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.	Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.	Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?	Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.	Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."	Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.	Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Go on. Spill it.	Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?	You know I don't think that.
You know I don't think that.	Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.	You mean Delaware?
You mean Delaware?	No. New York.
No. New York.	New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?	No ...
No ...	Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?	Well, if that's possible ...
Well, if that's possible ...	It's possible. Just negotiate.
It's possible. Just negotiate.	Are we talking to a union spokesman?
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?	I thought maybe you forgot...
I thought maybe you forgot...	Forgot what?
Forgot what?	It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Lus! Come down here!	Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Where's your mama?	She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...	I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...	The what!
The what!	The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.	Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?	But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.	You've got to help around the house!
You've got to help around the house!	But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...	You should have helped her without being asked.
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...	You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...	Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...	You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...	Ramn -- listen my kids ...
Ramn -- listen my kids ...	T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!	My kids don't have enough to eat!
My kids don't have enough to eat!	You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?	I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.	You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.	Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...	What attitude?
What attitude?	You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.	He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?	Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.	Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.	That's it?
That's it?	Are you Australian?
Are you Australian?	No.
No.	Good. I fucking hate Australians.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?	Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.	You mind?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.	I was talking to my wife.
Bobby?	Shhh.
What?	The spiders.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.	Yeah.
Yeah.	What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?	Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
What?	Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.	Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.	Not even a guess?
Not even a guess?	
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.	How about in the house?
How about in the house?	They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.	Did you see his hair color?
Did you see his hair color?	No, Why?
What is it?	Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Ride 'em cowboy)	You like that?
You like that?	Who wouldn't?
Who wouldn't?	First rate, ain't it?
First rate, ain't it?	It's downright classy is what it is.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.	Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.	Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.	Now that's down-right insulting.
Now that's down-right insulting.	I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.	Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Yeah.	Everything go?
Everything go?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises	I ain't a idiot, asshole.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.	I'll see you tonight.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.	I understand. Thanks anyway.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.	I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Oh God.	Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
How?	I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.
Leave me out of this.	That bad, huh?
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.	Ouch.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.	This man sounds like a real catch.
This man sounds like a real catch.	Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.	Colette ...
What?	Nothing.
Nothing.	Go ahead.
Go ahead.	Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?	It's not that easy.
It's not that easy.	Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.	Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.	Then leave.
Then leave.	I can't.
I can't.	Why not?
Why not?	You don't understand.
You don't understand.	There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.	I can't leave.
I can't leave.	You get off on abuse or something?
You get off on abuse or something?	Fuck you.
Fuck you.	Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.	Because he'll kill me.
Why don't you call the cops?	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.	That's long enough to get out of town.
That's long enough to get out of town.	I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.	How?
Oh. Hi.	What happened to your eye?
What happened to your eye?	Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?	Don't worry. He's out of town.
Don't worry. He's out of town.	How far out of town?
How far out of town?	Trust me. We're safe.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."	Never heard of him.
Never heard of him.	Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.	Like you?
Like you?	Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.	And you admire that?
And you admire that?	It's the only way to play.
Is that how you play?	I try.
: What are you up to?	Nothing.
Nothing.	What do you want from me, Colette?
What do you want from me, Colette?	I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?	It gets me through the day.
It gets me through the day.	You really need to lighten up.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.	This has nothing to do with him.
This has nothing to do with him.	So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?	Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?	How much time do you have?
How much time do you have?	What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?	How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.	Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?	There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.	You don't like the tune, find another station.
You don't like the tune, find another station.	What are you hiding, Danny?
What are you hiding, Danny?	Therapy session is over.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?	No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Who is it?	It's me.
It's me.	I'm kind of busy.
I'm kind of busy.	Please open the door, Danny.
We been through that.	What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.	I need my paycheck.
I need my paycheck.	You can still work.
You can still work.	He knows where I work.
He knows where I work.	Find a new job.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.	You always been this stubborn?
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.	Ass first into the world.
Ass first into the world.	I been that way ever since.
Why not?	I just can't. Okay?
What's wrong, Danny?	Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.	I can't tell you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.
They would have killed you too.	Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Really, I don't want to.	I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
What is it?	Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.	I don't want to.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.	Why?
Why?	Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.	Danny, it's not what you think.
Colette, go.	I don't want to leave you.
I don't want to leave you.	Your daughter needs you.  Go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.	That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.	These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
How you holding up?	I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.	Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Oh shit	What?
What?	Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Who is it?	It's Tom.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?	Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?	I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.	Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?	You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.	Maybe I am dealing with it.
Maybe I am dealing with it.	I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.	Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.	I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?	It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.	How?
How the hell did we get this detail?	Guess it's our turn.
What time is it?	Twelve
Twelve	Midnight?
Where to?	I know a guy.
I know a guy.	Lead the way.
Nice day	I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?	Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.	Why's that?
Why's that?	My features. They're Finnish.
My features. They're Finnish.	You don't say.
You don't say.	Finland is a country.
Finland is a country.	Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.	Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
I'm hurting.	You on a roll?
You on a roll?	Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?	Sorry.
Sorry.	Why does it have to feel so bad?
Why does it have to feel so bad?	You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
That's a good one.	I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.	I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
So, why'd you want to see me?	Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.	See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
What?	You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.	Don't get carried away.
Don't get carried away.	I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?	Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.	I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...	A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Fuuuuuck	Can your man handle that?
Can your man handle that?	I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.	Can you set that up?
Can you set that up?	Sure.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.	10%.  That's ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?	The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
You wanna score some go-fast?	Not tonight.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?	Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.	You mean, like to throw 'em off?
You mean, like to throw 'em off?	Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?	Palmdale
Palmdale	Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?	I think on account of his nose.
I think on account of his nose.	You're going to have to explain that one.
You're going to have to explain that one.	He doesn't have one.
He doesn't have one.	You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?	No  You think she's a tweaker?
You want a hit?	No. I'm good.
Can I ask you something?	Sure, Jimmy.
Sure, Jimmy.	What does J.F.K. stand for?
What does J.F.K. stand for?	John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.	Was he the president?
Was he the president?	Yes, Jimmy
Danny?	Yes, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy.	Thanks for not laughing at me.
What's this?	Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.	But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.	You aren't coming with me.
Okay	Wait till I tell you what it is.
Wait till I tell you what it is.	It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Why?	You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.	Hey, check it out...
What the hell is that?	It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
What?	I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
But...I've seen you.	When? When did you ever see me use?
When? When did you ever see me use?	This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?	You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
No one ever noticed?	Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
But... why? Why would you pretend?	I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.	You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?	I don't trust anybody.
I don't trust anybody.	And you want me to do you some big favor?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?	Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.	I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?	Good for you Jimmy.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.	You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?	That was my idea.
That was my idea.	You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
By not disgracing her memory!	What does that mean?
What does that mean?	You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
You don't understand.	Understand what?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.	Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.	No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.	Crank or glass?
Crank or glass?	The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?	No, I'm good.
No, I'm good.	I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Not bad.	Secret recipe.
Can we talk price?	Make me an offer.
Make me an offer.	I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?	I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.	Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.	Hey, okay.
You're serious?	Anything for a dear friend.
Anything for a dear friend.	But I just met you.
But I just met you.	But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?	If you say so.
If you say so.	Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.	Hey, I was just trying to ...
Hey, I was just trying to ...	I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.	Hey, I don't play that.
You want to do this some other time?	Pull your pants down.
Pull your pants down.	I'm sorry?
I'm sorry?	Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Come on, guys ...	Big Bill.
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.	Big Bill
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.	What?!
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.	Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Please .. I don't know what you're ...	Uh-uh-uh ...
Shoot him.	Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'	I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!	Yeah.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.	Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.	What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?	No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?	I'll keep that in mind.
What the hell is this?	Just some buddies.
Just some buddies.	This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.	What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Cool it. We got business.	Yeah, dickhead.
I've got a hot one.	You go, boy.
You go, boy.	If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?	Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
You got a name?	Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.	What?
What?	Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.	No last name?
No last name?	It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.	God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.	Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Danny, I'm touched.	Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
You think I'm a Judas?	Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.	Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.	Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Thanks for not judging me.	It's not my place.
It's not my place.	Don't you wonder why I do it?
Don't you wonder why I do it?	The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
You don't find that repugnant?	Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.	Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.	Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
I was getting to it.	Tell me what?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.	Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.	When?
When?	Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
What the hell are you doing here?	Question is, what are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?	I was trying to score some dope.
I was trying to score some dope.	Cut the shit, Flynne.
Cut the shit, Flynne.	Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?	Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
You think this is funny motherfucker?	I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.	This chink have a name?
This chink have a name?	Bubba.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.	After that ass-whipping you gave me?
What're your taking down?	Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?	Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
You've got no choice.	Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?	Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...	For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.	No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Bullshit. He's a liar.	News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.	You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
That's because he doesn't have one.	Whata you mean?  He told me -
Whata you mean?  He told me -	Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.	What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?	That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.
I'm afraid so, Danny.	Who is it?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.	We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Murder.  Beautiful.	Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.	Jesus.
Jesus.	I thought you'd be happy.
I thought you'd be happy.	Yeah.
Danny?	My name is Tom.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?	Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Please ... don't do this ...	Answer the fucking question!
This the guy?	It speaks!
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.	Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.	Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.	What's he holding?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?	Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.	Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?	Yeah.  What about him?
Yeah.  What about him?	Turns out he's connected.
Turns out he's connected.	To who?
To who?	The Mexicali Boys
The Mexicali Boys	And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.	What?!
What?!	And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.	Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
We know what's going on.	I still don't know what you're talking about.
Jimmy?	Who the hell is Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?	He's the only one I told.
He's the only one I told.	And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What's on the other end of this thing?	Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.	Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.	Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
What's that smell?	That would be me.
That would be me.	What'd you do, piss your pants?
What'd you do, piss your pants?	Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.	Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.	No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Excuse me?	Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.	Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?	They have. But they never found a lab.
You're lucky, Flynne.	Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.	We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.	What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?	You mean the menacing red car?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?	Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
When is the deal going down?	I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.	Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
Nervous?	With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.	Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.	And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.	Again, I thank you.
Again, I thank you.	I was talking about Miles.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.	And you've got wiener breath.
And you've got wiener breath.	Really?
Really?	It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Tom, let's spend the night here.	There's no motels around here.
There's no motels around here.	No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?	Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?	You mean like the Donner Party?
You mean like the Donner Party?	Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?	Tom, quit fucking around.
Tom, quit fucking around.	Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Look at that place. It's creepy.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?	I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.	Just no pleasing you, is there?
Just no pleasing you, is there?	Just admit you're wrong.
Just admit you're wrong.	We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?	Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.	No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.	Here it comes, poor Tom.
Here it comes, poor Tom.	But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.	That is so unfair.
My sentiments exactly.	Why are you doing this?
You thinking what I'm thinking?	Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.	That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.	Don't we always take good care of you?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.	Now that's scary!
We're in business.	Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.	Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Where's Bubba?	Maybe he isn't showing.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.	What is it, drugs?
What is it, drugs?	Better than drugs.
What is that? Rum and coke?	Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.	I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?	No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.	I thought you were done.
Find a chaplain.	...alright, let me know when.
Report.	Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.	Resistance?
Resistance?	A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.	Casualties?
Casualties?	Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.	It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Where are your men now?
Where are your men now?	Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.	I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.	Sir?
Sir?	There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.

A private, sir?	He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.	But, sir...I...I...
But, sir...I...I...	Spit it out, Captain.
Spit it out, Captain.	Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.	The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
So, where are you from?	You writin' a book or somethin'?
You writin' a book or somethin'?	As a matter of fact, I am.
As a matter of fact, I am.	Figured.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.	In West Fork?
In West Fork?	In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.	No kidding.
No kidding.	I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.	So they travel around from place to place and preach?
So they travel around from place to place and preach?	We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.

I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.	What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.	The Army gave you that?
The Army gave you that?	Yep.
Yep.	You must be a hell a shot.
You must be a hell a shot.	Not where I come from.
That must be four thousand yards.	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.	You take account of the wind?
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.	Shit, that was no big deal.
Jackson?	Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.	You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?	Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.	Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.	You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.	They got squirrels there, too, right?
Last I knew.	Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.	Shut up, will you?
Shut up, will you?	You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.	Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.	The hell he didn't.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?	Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
So, that's Ryan.	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.	Cap'n...?
Yes, sir.	Of course, sir.
Y'all come back.	Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?	Hell, no!
What do you think?	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.	I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.	I guess.
He ain't Wade.	Nope, he ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.	Like hell, you did.
No kiddin'?	What deal?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...	Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.	I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.	You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.	I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.	I'd love to hear it.
I'd love to hear it.	Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.	Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Yes, sir.

Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.	Wade?
Where?	In the shadow by those two trees.
In the shadow by those two trees.	My guess, too.
We left them eighty-eights.	They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Watching.	Gives Wade the second shot.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.	Who's Wade?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.	You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?	Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.	Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Not yet.	Keep trying.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.	Say what, Cap'n?
Say what, Cap'n?	You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.

Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?	It's worth it.
It's worth it.	To each, his own.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.	White-walls?
White-walls?	No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.	A half-track, anything.
A half-track, anything.	Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
How about that jeep?	That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.	Senator's son?
Senator's son?	No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.	FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?	That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Glad of it.	On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.	DASHES across the street.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...	It was nothing.
It was nothing.	But you could have gotten killed and I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...	Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Upham?	Pass.
Pass.	Sarge?
I wasn't made for this.	You think the rest of us were?
It looks like a Renoir.	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?	I've been humming it.
I've been humming it.	I heard.
I heard.	It seemed appropriate.
It seemed appropriate.	You know classical music?
You know classical music?	Some.
Some.	Where are you from, Captain?
Over three-hundred.	I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.	If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.	I don't expect to live that long.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.	Did he see any sign of them?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.	Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
What is it?	A machine gun.
Good luck, Captain.	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.	The men said, nine.
The men said, nine.	What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.	That only leaves three.
That only leaves three.	Plenty.
I wonder where they're going.	Same place we are.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.	Those guns are close.
What about our grenades?	Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.	Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?	Sure, you got one?
Sure, you got one?	The Germans do.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.	But, sir...
But, sir...	There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.	Goddamn it, sir...
Goddamn it, sir...	That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
What'd you say, Captain?	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Captain, what about our deal?	I changed my mind.
GO!	Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Worked, didn't it?	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?	Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Caen?	I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.	You?  Leading a squad?
You?  Leading a squad?	Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.	What about the company?
What about the company?	Simpson.
Simpson.	Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!	I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.	Beasley's dead.
Beasley's dead.	Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Okay, Wade.  Translators?	Fresh out.
Fresh out.	What about Talbot?
What about Talbot?	Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
You get a translator, Captain?	I've got a line on one.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.	We in radio contact with anybody up there?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?	Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.	Hell of a mission.
Hell of a mission.	Yep, hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...	PUSH!
PUSH!	Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?	That's not what we're here for.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.	Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.	Maybe.
Maybe.	It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.	Since when have things been normal?
Since when have things been normal?	You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?	Nope.
Nope.	Good news?
You think they'll be alright?	They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.	And what about you?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.	Nope.
Nope.	Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.	Three for three.
Three for three.	If we stayed, we could make a difference.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.	You're kidding yourself.
You're kidding yourself.	You never know.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.	Yup, hell of a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.	Is it getting worse?
Is it getting worse?	No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.	You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.	I'll be alright.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?	How about I go right, sir?
How about I go right, sir?	How about you take your position?
How about...?	How about you shut up and take your position?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!	Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.	About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.	More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...	Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.	Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
You alright?	Let's just find someplace.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?	Vecchio.
Vecchio.	Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?	Yeah.
Yeah.	You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?	Bits and pieces.
Bits and pieces.	She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.

And what about your own hand?	No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?

It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.	Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?	Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.

So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.	And how do you bluff yourself?
And how do you bluff yourself?	Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.

Except this time, the mission IS a man.	That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.	John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.	I think you're right, Keith.
I think you're right, Keith.	You want me to take over?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.	Just what I want to do.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.	I know.
I know.	Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.	I'll do my best.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.	You're welcome, John.
You're welcome, John.	But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.	Yes, sir.
What do you think?	Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.	What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Uh, oh.	Out of the mouth of babes.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.	Yes, sir.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?	Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.	Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?	Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?	Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.	Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
I don't think so, Captain.	Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.	Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...	Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.	No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?	Trust me, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.	But, sir...
Captain, can I ask you a question?	Sure, Reiben.
Sure, Reiben.	Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.	Yeah, how so?
Yeah, how so?	I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.

There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.	Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.	There's always a bright side.
There's always a bright side.	I'm listening, sir.
I'm listening, sir.	Well, I, for one, like cheese.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.	Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?	Sure, what do you want to know?
Sure, what do you want to know?	Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?	Ours is not to reason why.
Ours is not to reason why.	Huh?
Huh?	Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.	I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.	Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.	Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.	You have orders, too.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?	I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.	Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.	But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Any further thoughts on the subject?	Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.	I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.	We can't leave it here.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?	Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.	Why's that?
Why's that?	Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.	Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.	B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.

I don't like that one.	Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.	But we accomplish the mission.
But we accomplish the mission.	Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.	Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?	No, sir.
No, sir.	That's a mystery to me.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.	What if our guys open up, sir?
What if our guys open up, sir?	You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.	Have it your way, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.	You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Maybe Caen.	Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.	See to it.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.	HERE THEY COME!
HERE THEY COME!	OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Get back to your positions!
What deal?	I coach the baseball team, too.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?	That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:	Here they come.
Here they come.	FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.	Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Goddamn it!	More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.	Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.	This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?	I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Thank you, sir.	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.	Alright, come with me.
I'd like to go, sir.	No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Don't do that again.	I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
You set?  Sarge nods.	Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.	Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.	Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Yes, Private.	Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?	Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.	Yeah?
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.	And Sarge?
And Sarge?	Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.	That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.	No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.	As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.	Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.	You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.	Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.	We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...	...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Shit, sir.	Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.	Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Who cares?	I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?	Frogs?
Frogs?	Lingerie.
Lingerie.	Yeah?  So?
I usually like surprises.	What are we likely to run into?
Damn fool.  Sir.	Captain, he's fast!
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.	Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
So, where are you from?	Get lost.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.	We know.
We know.	Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.	What about you, Captain?
Demolition, right?	Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
How do you do it?	It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
You think he really believed it?	Who knows?  It worked.
How fast?	Twenty-four-five.
Twenty-four-five.	Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.	We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.	Pardon me?
Pardon me?	Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.	What's the profile?
What's the profile?	Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?

You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.	Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.	How can you, how can you say that?
How can you, how can you say that?	Because he's guilty.
Because he's guilty.	No, no he's not.
No, no he's not.	We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.	Understanding the following rights...
Understanding the following rights...	Speak with my lawyer.
Speak with my lawyer.	So you refuse to answer my questions?
So you refuse to answer my questions?	Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.	Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...

This evening is over.	And your former wife.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...	What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.	Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.	That's right.
That's right.	Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?	Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Hi.	Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 	No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.	For going to school?
For going to school?	Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.	Good for her.
Good for her.	I'll take the whole set.
I'll take the whole set.	Excellent.
Thanks, I like yours too.	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.	Okay, thanks.
Keep it.	You're sure?
You're sure?	Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
Lloyd?	Hey, sis.
Hey, sis.	I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.	I hope you understand.
I hope you understand.	Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.	How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?	Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.	Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?	Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?	Gee, it's easy.
Gee, it's easy.	Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.

Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.	Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?	I'll be home soon.
That's unlikely.	The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?	But you never had a first date.
But you never had a first date.	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.	That's not even a scam.
That's not even a scam.	What's a scam?
What's a scam?	Going out as friends.
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.
I'm gonna call her.	Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.	Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Look at those eyes.	Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd, give it up.	Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.	Lloyd.
Lloyd.	C'mon, just do it.
C'mon, just do it.	C'mon Lloyd.
C'mon Lloyd.	Please?
Please?	That's just so embarrassing.
That's just so embarrassing.	Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 	Okay, I got it.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.	Hang in there, man.
Hang in there, man.	Yes.
Yes.	See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.	See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Did you sleep with her?	I admit nothing.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.	Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.	So, what's your point?
So, what's your point?	You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Alright.	Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.	I already did.
What does it say?	Read it.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.	Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
No, you're not a guy.	I am.
I am.	The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.	If she wants me, she can come to me.
I don't feel anything.	Come on, it's graduation.
Come on, it's graduation.	Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.	He wants to leave things on a good note.
He wants to leave things on a good note.	Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.	I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Lloyd is doomed.	Meaning?
Meaning?	Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
I told him to be himself.	He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Lloyd, it's us.	Look at his face, he did the deed.
Look at his face, he did the deed.	You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Wait a minute.	You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...	Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.	And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...	You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.	What?  I'm sorry, talk.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.	I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?	I dream about it.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.	I just saw Joe.  He's here.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.	Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
Why?	It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.	What is wrong with this girl?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.	If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.	One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?	One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.	I can accept that.
I can accept that.	And I want to turn the home over to the state.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.	He'd like to start serving immediately.
He'd like to start serving immediately.	I can put that together.
I can put that together.	Confirm this with my office and my client.
Confirm this with my office and my client.	I'll put this past my boss
I'll put this past my boss	Alright.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.	I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.	Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Visit her at the home.	I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.	Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?	'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.	Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.	Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!	You like it?
You like it?	Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!	I didn't think anyone would get it.
I didn't think anyone would get it.	Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!	Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.	Okay.
Ha!	Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.	Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
What are you doing?	Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.	Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.	Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
They really applauded you today honey.	I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.	No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?	Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.	Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...	Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	I love you dad.
I love you dad.	I love you too honey.
What?	I just had a phone call.
I just had a phone call.	Tell me, is it bad news?
Tell me, is it bad news?	No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.	Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!	You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.	I won?
I won?	You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.	We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.	No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Morning honey.	Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.	Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?	Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?	Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...	Dad.
Dad.	Now why can't I tell the story?
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.	I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.	Crash paranoia.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.	And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.	Which they did.  Let me finish.
Which they did.  Let me finish.	Okay, I give up.
Okay, I give up.	So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.	Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Morning.	Dad, I'm sorry.
Dad, I'm sorry.	You should be.
You should be.	I was irresponsible, I should have called.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.	You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.	Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.	You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.	I'm fine.
I'm fine.	Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.	I know that.
Lloyd?	Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.	Sit down.
Did he ever get rough with you?	Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.	You're going.
You're going.	But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.	You're going.
You're going.	It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.	Bon voyage.
Bon voyage.	You're not listening to me.
You're not listening to me.	Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.	Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Do you love him?	I like him a lot.
I like him a lot.	Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.	Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.	Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.	Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.	'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...	Dad, I love him.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Dad, are you okay in there?	Just finishing up in here.
What happened to you?	Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?	Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.	Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.	Honey!
Honey!	Swear to god.
Swear to god.	I swear to god.
I swear to god.	But I found the money.
But I found the money.	Honey, it's not what you think.
Honey, it's not what you think.	What am I supposed to think?
What am I supposed to think?	Honey, about what?
Honey, about what?	You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?	You think you know what this money is?
You think you know what this money is?	Yes, I...
Yes, I...	No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...	No, but you stole from them.
No, but you stole from them.	I made their lives better.
I made their lives better.	You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...	Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.	I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.	Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?	No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.	That's right, work it out.
That's right, work it out.	No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.	Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.	I'm so ashamed dad.
I'm so ashamed dad.	Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...	You're right.
Hello.	Hi.
Hi.	I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Mom, please?	Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.	This is me telling you about me.
This is me telling you about me.	You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?	I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.	If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?	If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?	Alright.
Alright.	You will?
You will?	Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Thank-you.  The real world.	Look at those eyes.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?	Hi.  You called me?
Hi.  You called me?	Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.

Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?	Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.	Busy?
Busy?	Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.	Are you busy on Friday?

So you're monumentally busy?	Well, not monumentally.
Well, not monumentally.	What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?	Hmmm....
Hmmm....	Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
Actually, I think that I...	Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Well...	No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.	I'll go.

Pardon me?	I'll go.

Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?	Eight.
Eight.	Eight. Eight O' clock.
Eight. Eight O' clock.	Goodbye.
Goodbye.	Goodbye.
Whoa.	Would you hold this for me?
Would you hold this for me?	Yeah
What are these?	They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.	Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?	No.
Keymaster?	Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.	So it's an honor?
So it's an honor?	No.
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
He does this every year?	It's the worst job since keymaster.
Thank-you.	I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Have a good sleep.	Bye.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...	Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"	Nobody knew me before tonight.
Nobody knew me before tonight.	They knew of you.  Now they know you.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.	Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.	That's cool then.
That's cool then.	Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
It's just you and your dad, right?	Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.	Sure I do.
Sure I do.	Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?	Watch out for that glass.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...	Twisted?
Twisted?	You know what?
You know what?	What?
What?	You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.	Basic.  Hmmm.
Basic.  Hmmm.	So what's your job this summer?
So what's your job this summer?	Job?  Being a great date.
Job?  Being a great date.	No, I'm serious.
No, I'm serious.	So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.	I only have something like sixteen weeks.

Today is tomorrow.	Then call me later.
Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.	Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Nice one.	Yeah?
Yeah?	I think you should wear that.
I think you should wear that.	You think so?
You think so?	Mmmm.
Oh.	I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
After work?	I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.	Won't you see me later?
Won't you see me later?	I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?	Me?  Sure I do.
Me?  Sure I do.	Come on.
Come on.	Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.	Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Stop by later.	Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye, I will.	Okay, bye.
Okay, bye.	I'll see you there.  Bye.

It's okay, everybody does that.	I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?

Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.	Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
It's your castle, man.	Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.	Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.

Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.	Hello Lloyd.
Hello Lloyd.	Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.

My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.	Fine Lloyd.
Fine Lloyd.	How ya doing?  Is she around?
How ya doing?  Is she around?	Yeah.  Honey?
Thanks Lloyd.	How do you pay for one of those?
How do you pay for one of those?	Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?	Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.	Seriously, Lloyd.
Seriously, Lloyd.	I'm totally and completely serious.
I'm totally and completely serious.	No, really.
No, really.	You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...	Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.	I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...	Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?	That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.	Are you?
Are you?	Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.

You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.	I know.
I know.	She's very successful.
She's very successful.	I know
I know	Very talented.
Very talented.	I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.	You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.	I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?	I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."	I know this part, keep reading.
I know this part, keep reading.	She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.	It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.	Just her name.
Just her name.	Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.	So what's up?
So what's up?	Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.	Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
My car.	Your car?
Diane Court.	Dude, I can't do it!
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.	How ya doin' Miss Evans?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?	You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.	No way.
No way.	Lloyd.
Lloyd.	What?
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.	My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.	We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.	How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.	Hang tough, Lloyd.

Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?	I called her up.
I called her up.	Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?	I'm Lloyd Dobler.

Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.	We're full on bonded.
We're full on bonded.	Yeah, alright.
Later for you, Luke.	I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Oskar - my friend Lena.	How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?	Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?	Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.	Now you're back.
Now you're back.	Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -	Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.	He is.
Well, let's find him.	He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.	I'm talking to a clerk.
What's your name?	Sir, the list is correct.
Sir, the list is correct.	I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.	Klaus Tauber.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.	My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
You know what, you'd like her.	Oskar, please -
Oskar, please -	What -
What -	I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.	You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
It's not a charade, all this?	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
Luck.	War.
What?	I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Should I stay?	It's a beautiful city.
Should I stay?	It's up to you.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.	I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that.	There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.	I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
All right, okay, let's talk.	In Breslau.
In Breslau.	Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
We started without you.	Good.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.	You're kidding.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.	I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -	They're not gone, they're here.
They're not gone, they're here.	They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -	We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -	It's bad business.
It's bad business.	Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
Scherner told me something else about you.	Yeah, what's that?
Yeah, what's that?	That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.	True.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.	Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.	I pay you too much.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.	He's important to my business.
He's important to my business.	What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.	I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.	What's going on?
What's going on?	I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
You took my workers.	They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.	When?
When?	I don't know.  Soon.
You want these people.	These people, my people, I want my people.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?	It's good business.
It's good business.	Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.	Look -
Look -	You're not telling me something.
You're not telling me something.	It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.	Yeah, sure.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?	I just told you.
I just told you.	You did, but you didn't.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.	All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Where are the guards?	The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
What's that?	You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.	You asked for shoe polish.
You asked for shoe polish.	My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.	So I'm responsible for the weather?
So I'm responsible for the weather?	I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.	This is not my problem.
This is not my problem.	Look it up.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?	Yeah, I can.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.	Of course I'm on it.
Of course I'm on it.	You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
What do I got for you?	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.	You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.	That's great.
That's great.	I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.	That's great, thanks.
That's great, thanks.	God bless you, sir.
God bless you, sir.	Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay.	You're a good man.
Like this?	There's nothing in the stores.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?	Nice things cost money.
How many?	I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
How you feeling, all right?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?	She's good.
What's wrong with it?	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Good.  How's it going?	Things are great, things are great.
What are you doing?	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.	I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.	I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.	I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.	Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Oskar, good of you to come.	Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.	How do you do?
Thank you.	I need a drink.
I need a drink.	Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?	Wine?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.	We're losing the war, aren't we.
We're losing the war, aren't we.	It kind of looks that way.
It kind of looks that way.	Pistols?
Pistols?	Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -	No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.	What others?
What others?	Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
That'd be fine.	Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.	So I'll talk to him about it.
So I'll talk to him about it.	He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -	He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.	Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
I was just the accountant.	Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?	I think most people right now have other priorities.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."	The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.	Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.	Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Pots and pans.	Something they can hold in their hands.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.	They should be.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?	The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.	But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?	Yes.
Yes.	Better this month than last?
Better this month than last?	Yes.
Yes.	Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?	The war could end.
What?	There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Don't ever do that to me again.	Do what?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?	Christmas presents.
Christmas presents.	Ah, yes.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.	Thank you.
I got to go, I'll see you.	Oskar -
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.	Are you losing money?
Are you losing money?	No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.	What other point is -
What other point is -	It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...	And killing.
And killing.	I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?	There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.
I think it's too late.	Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Four hundred, four fifty -	More.
Eight hundred, give or take.	Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
That's very generous of you.	Yes.
We need to talk.	Stern.
They arrived.	They arrived, can you believe it?
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.	They're withholding payment.
They're withholding payment.	Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.	No?
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.	You'll lose money.
I'll talk to you later.	No, no, what, what is it?
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...	Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...	There will be generations because of what you did.
There will be generations because of what you did.	I didn't do enough.
I didn't do enough.	You did so much.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.	I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.	File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.	Would it do any good?
Would it do any good?	No.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.	Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
We know that, son.	The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.	We're aware of that.
I can do it, Captain.	Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
How's the name search going?	37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Can't we hold him?	No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.	What now?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.	That doesn't work, sir.
Have you checked the...	Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.	Take the neighborhood.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.	The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.	Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
He's broken his pattern.	They've broken their pattern.
They've broken their pattern.	You're sure about this two person thing?
You're sure about this two person thing?	Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I would say we are now officially baffled.	On national television.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.	thought he was doing AA.
thought he was doing AA.	No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.	I won't.
I won't.	Don't. Think Bailey.
Don't. Think Bailey.	Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.	It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Shit.	What is it?
What is it?	I heard a noise.
I heard a noise.	Where?
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...	Stop it...
Stop it...	I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Outside.	That's smart.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...	What? I can't hear you...
What? I can't hear you...	Hang up...call...
Hang up...call...	I'm losing you.
I'm losing you.	...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Yes.	Who is this?
Who is this?	Cici. Who's this?
Cici. Who's this?	Someone who wants to talk to you.
Someone who wants to talk to you.	Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.	That's okay.
That's okay.	Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.	Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?	We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.	Why aren't you there?
Why aren't you there?	I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.	That's too bad.
That's too bad.	"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?	What if I said you?
What if I said you?	What if I said goodbye?
What if I said goodbye?	Why would you wanna do that?
Why would you wanna do that?	Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?	I'm inquisitive.
I'm inquisitive.	I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
Hello? Ted?	No, it's me.
WHAAAATT?	Don't forget to set the alarm.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?	I live here.
I live here.	I thought you were going to the mixer?
I thought you were going to the mixer?	I had to change. Did anyone call?
I had to change. Did anyone call?	Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.	I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Cotton.	Can we talk?
Can we talk?	I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think that's a good idea.	Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.	What do you want from me, Cotton?
What do you want from me, Cotton?	You could start with an apology.
You could start with an apology.	I did that.
I did that.	You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.	How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?	I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.	Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.	Did it?
Did it?	It helped me realize one thing.
It helped me realize one thing.	What?
What?	You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.	Please, Cotton, dont do this.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.	Its over, Cotton.
Its over, Cotton.	Not until youre dead.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?	Did you do it?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?	You have a right to be angry.
You have a right to be angry.	No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.	Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.	You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.	Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.	Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?	Fair enough.
Fair enough.	What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.	And much richer as a result.
And much richer as a result.	Do I know you? You look familiar.
Do I know you? You look familiar.	I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.	Good for you.
Hi, Gale, any leads?	Tons and tons.
Tons and tons.	Where is Sidney's father?
Where is Sidney's father?	Home--where he lives.
Home--where he lives.	And are the police sure about that?
And are the police sure about that?	Why don't you ask them?
Why don't you ask them?	Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?	No, I don't.
No, I don't.	Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.	Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.	Youre all in this together?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.	Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
What are you going to do?	Finish what my son started.
Finish what my son started.	But youll never get away with it.
But youll never get away with it.	Enter Cotton Weary.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
My documentary is due on Tuesday.	What's your subject?
What's your subject?	I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
I could use some therapy.	Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I think he's doing Dolly.	"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."	Definitely Whitney.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?	Not one bit.
Not one bit.	Where's Sid?
Where's Sid?	She dumped me.
She dumped me.	No way.
No way.	Yeah.
Yeah.	You freakin?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...	I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.	I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?	Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.	Sid, you don't have to.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.	I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
About what?	The forbidden subject.
Lemme take you home.	I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.	Let us decide that.
Let us decide that.	What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?	It's under control.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?	No, it's not.
No, it's not.	I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.	It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.	Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
Go on, untie him.	No. This is a set up.
No. This is a set up.	Thats quick.
Why?	Good question. You took the bait.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?	Youre not going to get away with this.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.	But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
Two.	So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...	And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Where's Sid?	Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.	You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.	I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
She's got guards with her.	What guy?
What guy?	Randy somebody.
He seemed harmless.	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Need some help, honey.	I got it..
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.	Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.	I really dont like that comparison, honey.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.	He hates Oliver Stone.
He hates Oliver Stone.	I find his work overwrought.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.	I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...	We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.	Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.	Youre the one who got away.
Youre the one who got away.	Until now.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?	The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.	A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.	Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.	And now, drum roll please...
And now, drum roll please...	Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
A twist ending if you will.	Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.	..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...	And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.	So we found a compromise.
So we found a compromise.	Or it found us.
Or it found us.	We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.	Just for you, Sid.
Just for you, Sid.	Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?	Tails.
We had to have financing.	Tuitions expensive.
Hello, Dwight.	Miss Weathers.
Miss Weathers.	I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...	I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.	I see you read the book.
I see you read the book.	Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.	And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.	Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.	Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.	No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
You have every right to be upset.	Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."	I never meant to imply...
I never meant to imply...	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.	No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?	Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.	You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.	I think you're all an act.
I think you're all an act.	And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.	I know that.
I know that.	Yeah?
Yeah?	I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good. How you doin?	Not good.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?	Meaning?
Meaning?	He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?	Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.	Billy had alibis too.
You broke my heart.	What are we looking for?
What are we looking for?	A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?	Can we turn the light on?
Can we turn the light on?	That's not the way it's done.
And it's sexier in the dark.	Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.	Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...	..and as lonely as I am...
..and as lonely as I am...	We'd break some furniture.
They're roomates.	And Joel's pre-med.
And Joel's pre-med.	The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.	Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.	Hallie?
Ssshh! What was that?	Let's find out.
This is all too familiar.	Over here.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.	C'mon. Let's go.
Jesus Christ!	He filmed his victims.
Let's go.	No, wait here.
Dewey?	There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?	They thought it was a publicity stunt.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.	Oh my God. How could it happen?
Oh my God. How could it happen?	They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.	It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.	Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.	Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.	No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.	Don't worry...
Don't worry...	Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...	Just in case...
Just in case...	No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.	Dewey, there's no such place.
Dewey, there's no such place.	Humor me, Sid.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.	Whatever.
Who is this?	I'll give you one guess.
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.
That's not the way we play the game.	I don't play games.
I don't play games.	What if your life depended on it?
What do you want?	You're pretty when you're angry.
Where are you?	I'm everywhere.
Oh--a God complex	Stay away from the cop.
What do you want from me?	It's what you want from me.
What do you mean?	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.	You're getting obvious.
You're getting obvious.	No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.	No, wait...
No, wait...	Watch your back.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?	I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.	It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?	It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.	It's good to see you involved.
It's good to see you involved.	My morn was a Delta.
Sid, I'll come with you.	But who would operate your camera?
What?	Oh my God.
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.	Are you in danger now?
Are you in danger now?	Yes, goddammit!
Yes, goddammit!	Where is your attacker?
Where is your attacker?	I dont know.
I dont know.	Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.	The safety what? Fuck that!
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.	I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have rehearsal.	I have to watch rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.	Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.	Too bad.
He tried to kill her first.	Is Sid in therapy?
I got a surprise for you.	What?
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...	Don't do this.
Don't do this.	"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
You're going to get it. You know what happens.	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Knock yourself out.	Hello?  Hello?

Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?	Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.	What about rehearsal?
What about rehearsal?	Gotta.
Gotta.	I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
That was good.	Yeah, right.
Who is that guy?	It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.	No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.	I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.	No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.	No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.	I'd really just like to be alone.
Can I come with her?	No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.	It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.	You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.	The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...	Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...	Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.	Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.

The young girl is slashed again.
The young girl is slashed again.	The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
How many guys they have on you?	I counted four.
I've been waiting for you, baby.	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.	Her old boyfriend?
Her old boyfriend?	No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
And white.	Easy black boy.
Easy black boy.	It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?	This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?	You're not allowed to ask that.
You're not allowed to ask that.	I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.	Thanks, Joel.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.	Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.

SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?	Closer than you think.
Do you want to die?	Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
I hate scary movies.	It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.	If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.	We got free tickets.
Take it off.	But...
But...	Now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?	Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..	Shush.
Shush.	I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You ass.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.	You are so not funny.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?	I get scared really easy, okay.
I get scared really easy, okay.	You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.	We can still Sandra Bullock it.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.	Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.	Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.	What are you talking about?

I'll be right back.	Where you going?
What was that?	Don't panic.
What do you want?	I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.	Do you work for her now?
Do you work for her now?	Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.

Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.	Me, too. Randy. Me too.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.	I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.	I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?	I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.	I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.	Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.	Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.	Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.	And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.	Melinda McGraw?
Melinda McGraw?	No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.	Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.

All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.	Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.	I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.	Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .

Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?	More of a game really.
More of a game really.	What kind of a game?
What kind of a game?	You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.	I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!	Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!	Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.

Closer than you think.	Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?	To see your reaction.
To see your reaction.	Reaction to what?
Can I help you?	I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?	Nope.
Nope.	Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?	Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --	It may be Maureen Reynolds --
It may be Maureen Reynolds --	Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?	Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.	I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?	Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.	Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.	So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?	I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.	A note?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.	There's more.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.	I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.	And who would that be?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?	I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.	Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.	Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.	Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?	Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Who?	I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.	But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.	In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.	Please, call me Gale.
Please, call me Gale.	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!	Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Four? There are five.	Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.	Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!	Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Jesus Gale what happened?	He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!	Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.	Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
What do you know about trilogies?	You mean like, movie trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?	You seem to like movies, Detective.
You seem to like movies, Detective.	Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.	I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.	All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.	Did you request this case?
Did you request this case?	No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.	Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.	To me Hollywood is about death.
To me Hollywood is about death.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.	Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.	Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.	Hmm.
Hmm.	What did you know about your mother?
What did you know about your mother?	I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.	How is that good news?
How is that good news?	Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.	Oh yeah, how?
Oh yeah, how?	Catch him, or kill him.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?	Yeah. A real tragedy.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.	Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.	That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.	Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.	What does this have to do with Sid?
What does this have to do with Sid?	Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?	Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Is that a threat, Detective?	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.	Is that a threat?
Detective Kincaid?	What Rielly?
What Rielly?	There's someone here who wants to help.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.	The killer called her.
The killer called her.	What?  When?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?	He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?	No.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.	And what made you think it was Sidney?
And what made you think it was Sidney?	Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.	Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.	What?
What?	I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.	Follow me.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.	Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
I can see nothing's changed.	No.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.	Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?	No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.	Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Yeah?	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!	Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!	Sid I can see you!
Sid I can see you!	Where are you Dewey?
Where are you Dewey?	I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Where's Gale?	They've got her!
They've got her!	Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.	Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.	DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.	Show him.
They found another note?	Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.	You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.	This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.	Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Do you really mean it this time Gale?	Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.	Why would the police come to you?
Why would the police come to you?	Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?	What about me?
What about me?	You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.	So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?	It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!	What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.	You used to say that was our strength.
You used to say that was our strength.	Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?	Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.	All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?	Off the record.
Off the record.	Always.
Always.	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.	And?
And?	The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.	Someone stole Sid's file?
Someone stole Sid's file?	I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.

What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?	Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 	I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.	And who is that?
Jennifer needs me.	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?	I'm on duty.
Stop following me.	I happen to work for the police god dammit!
I happen to work for the police god dammit!	You're not a detective.
You're not a detective.	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.	Gale, your engine's still running.
Gale, your engine's still running.	Fuck!
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
OH. OH GOD. GALE --	What?
What?	GALE BEHIND YOU!
Thank you.	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!	Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.	Has anyone else every used your phone?
Has anyone else every used your phone?	Just Jennifer.  And you.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.	Do you want us to come with you?
Do you want us to come with you?	I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Sidney, what happened?	Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.	Who is it?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.	Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.	Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
What's your point?	No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.	I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.	But you know who she was.
But you know who she was.	When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.	It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.	Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.

Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?	Honestly, my life.
Your life?	Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!	Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?	God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!	Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?	I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.	Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?	I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Who's phone?	Oh shit it's my cell!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?	What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?	I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Geez.	What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?	Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?	I am Gale Weathers!
I am Gale Weathers!	Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?

No really?	There a story in that building?
There a story in that building?	Possibly.
Possibly.	Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Basements creep me out.	Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.

Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.	Bitch.
Nobody said she was an actor.	Good twist.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!	Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.	Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.	Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?	Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.	GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.	Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?	Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.

Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?	Who?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?	Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Get real, that would make me a suspect!	Just because you knew her?
Just because you knew her?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?	Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.	Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.	It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.

Are you saying she was-	I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.	Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.	Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.	Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.	Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.	You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.	Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What'd he say?	Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?	Who's this.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.	What are you talking about?
Gale he's got Dewey!	I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know! He killed Kincaid!	I know!
I know!	Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here!	GALE WATCHOUT!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.	All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!	I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.	Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!	Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.	I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!	Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.	Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.	Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.	What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!	You're not happy with your part.
You're not happy with your part.	I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.	Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.

This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?	Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?	Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.	But you know my favorite name?
But you know my favorite name?	I'm hanging up right now.
I'm hanging up right now.	It's Sarah.
It's Sarah.	Roman that's not the line.
Roman that's not the line.	It is in my script.
It is in my script.	Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?	It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.	What?  What movie?
What?  What movie?	My movie.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.	And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.	SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".	Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.	I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.	Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?	No.
No.	Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?	W-what do you want?
W-what do you want?	I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.	You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!	Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.	No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.	Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.	The final act? Well let's play asshole!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!	No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.	Who is this?
Who is this?	The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?	Yes.
Yes.	Go there.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.	How do I know their voices are --
How do I know their voices are --	Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
You're dead!	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Where?	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.	WHERE?
WHERE?	I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yeah?	You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.	I thought you wanted me here?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.	It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello?	Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.	Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!	Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.	No I need to call you. Just you.
No I need to call you. Just you.	I'm sorry, your voice.
I'm sorry, your voice.	Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?	Who the fuck is this?
Who the fuck is this?	It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
What? She asked.	It's called tact, you fuckrag.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.	Sorry.
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
Owwww...	You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.	Sorry.
How'd you do?	Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.	Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.	So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?	Duh... that's quick.
Duh... that's quick.	I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?	Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.	Oh...
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
Dude. What are you doing here?	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.	Oh yeah.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.	It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.	And if you get it right -- you die.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.	Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Nope.	And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.	That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?	You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Ready?	Yeah...
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...	And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.	Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.	Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
It's on the table.	No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
She can't get both of us.	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.	Where the fuck did she go?
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!	I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?	I just wanted to see her, that's all.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.	You rode your bike out there?
You rode your bike out there?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.	We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
Billy? What the...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	You sleep in THAT?
My dad's in the other room.	I'll only stay a sec.
Close call.	What are you doing here?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.	Now that it's out of your system.
Now that it's out of your system.	And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.	Oh it did?
Oh it did?	Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.	So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.	No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
You know what my dad will do to you?	I'm going... I'm going.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?	What's that?
Oh Billy... Please... God...	I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...	He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Jesus, SHIT!	Hey, hey, it's just me.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.	I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?	I'm so sorry... please understand.
I'm so sorry... please understand.	Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.	You know that's not true.
You know that's not true.	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?	No...
No...	Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?	No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.	It's been a year since she died.
It's been a year since she died.	Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.	When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.	Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.	You have to move on, Sid.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.	It's okay. We need to talk.
So...	So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.	No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.	You lost your mom...
You lost your mom...	But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...	Oh Sidney...
Oh Sidney...	Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.	Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.	But this is life. This isn't a movie.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.	Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
I wanna let go. I do...	Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Sshh... it's okay.	Or even a good porno.
Or even a good porno.	What?
You heard me.	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	Yeah... I think so.
Who did you call?	What?
What?	When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?	I called my dad.
I called my dad.	No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.	Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	You don't still think it was me?
You don't still think it was me?	No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I thought you were...	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
NO! Don't believe him.	It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
Fuck you.	We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Why did you kill my mother?	Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
I don't understand...	We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.	Stop it!
Stop it!	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Hello?	Are you alone in the house?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?	Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.	Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.

Why? You wanna ask me out?	Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?	No.
No.	You never told me your name.
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.
I want to now who I'm talking to.	That's not what you said.

I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.	No it's not. It was Jason.
No it's not. It was Jason.	Afraid not.
Afraid not.	It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.	Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
You tricked me...	Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
...leave me alone... please...	Answer the question and I will.
What door am I at?	What?
What?	There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.	Your call.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?	Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
And why is that? Has something happened?	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.	I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.	Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.	Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.	Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.	We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.	Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?	No, not yet.
No, not yet.	He's not a suspect, is he?
He's not a suspect, is he?	We haven't ruled out that possibil...
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.	That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.	You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Evening, ma'am.	Deputy... good evening.
Deputy... good evening.	What brings you out to these parts?
What brings you out to these parts?	You never know when or where a story will break.
You never know when or where a story will break.	Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.	Then what are you doing here?
Then what are you doing here?	Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.	Mind if I join you?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.	What kind of lead?
What kind of lead?	A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.	I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?	Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.	Can I bring Kenny?
Can I bring Kenny?	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
So is Dewey your real name?	Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.	I like it. It's... sexy.
I like it. It's... sexy.	Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.	What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.	Sidney's father?
Sidney's father?	We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll call for backup.	I'll get my camera.
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.	You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Does mom know?	Yes, you doofus.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?	Hold up a sec...
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.	I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.	Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.	Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.	Shit.
What is she doing here?	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?	...yeah...
Did you reach my Dad?	You're sure it was the Hilton?
You're sure it was the Hilton?	At the airport.
At the airport.	He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?	I don't know. I guess.
I don't know. I guess.	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Any word on my Dad?	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.	Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.	I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.	And my Dad? Any word on him?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.	Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.	Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
You girls ready.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Have they found my father?	Afraid not.
Afraid not.	Should I be worried?
Should I be worried?	Not yet.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.	How is everything?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.	Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...	He's her boyfriend.
I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?
What were you doing out here?	Drive by patrol.
Drive by patrol.	How is she?
How is she?	She's tough.
She's tough.	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.	What about the cellular phone bill?
What about the cellular phone bill?	They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?	Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
She staying with you?	We haven't located her Dad yet.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.	Yes, sir, sheriff.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?	Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.	Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.	Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?	There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.	Have you contacted the bureau?
Have you contacted the bureau?	They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.	You think he could still be in town?
You think he could still be in town?	He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?	She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?	Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.	She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.	Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.	Yes, sir.
That fish smelled strong.	I told you to send it back.
Jesus...	What is it? Where's Casey?
What is it? Where's Casey?	Casey? Casey?
Where is she?	Call the police.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.	The phone's dead.
Where is she?	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Casey! Casey!	Not my daughter... not my...
What? What?	Jesus! The camera-hurry!
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.	You want to go live?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.	When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.	If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.	But it's so much easier when we make it up.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.	Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
What's the plan?	Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.	What's the delay?
What's the delay?	About thirty seconds.
About thirty seconds.	As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?	Yes, that's right.
How's the book?	It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.	I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.
Just stay back.	I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you.	Kenny. Camera. Now.
Off the record. No cameras.	Forget it.
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
You owe my mother.	Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.	And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.	What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.	Do you still think he's innocent?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.	During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.	I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.	Have you talked to Cotton?
Have you talked to Cotton?	Many times.
Many times.	Has his story changed?
Has his story changed?	Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.	He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.	He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...	I saw him leaving wearing it.
I saw him leaving wearing it.	But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.	Why would she lie about it?
Why would she lie about it?	For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?	And why would she do that?
And why would she do that?	Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.	Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
You're evil.	Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.	And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Where do you get this shit?	Ricki Lake.
I have no idea.	Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.	Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.	Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?	I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.	What's your favorite scary movie?
What's your favorite scary movie?	Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.	And why is that?
And why is that?	Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Are you alone in the house?	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.	Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.	So who are you?
So who are you?	The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?	So where are you?
So where are you?	Your front porch.
Why would you call me from my front porch?	That's the original part.
So where are you?	Right here.
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	What am I doing?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.	If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello?	Hello Sidney.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.	LEAVEMEALONE!
LEAVEMEALONE!	Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.	Who are you?
Are you okay?	Can you knock?
Can you knock?	I heard screaming.
I heard screaming.	No you didn't.
No you didn't.	No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...	...out at the airport...
...out at the airport...	...so call if you need me.
...so call if you need me.	Got it.
Have a good trip.	Sleep tight, sweetie.
Stu was with me last night.	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.	Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?	Working, thank you.
Working, thank you.	I thought Blockbuster fired you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.	Twice.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?	She's the Scream Queen.
Stop. Right there.	Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't shoot. It's me.	Don't come any closer.
Don't come any closer.	Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.	You got it.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.	Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
For about two seconds.	Before she dumped him for Steve.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?	What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?	It would certainly improve your high school Q.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."	I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.	Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
Jesus, this place is packed.	We had a run in the mass murder section.
We had a run in the mass murder section.	You coming tonight?
You coming tonight?	Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.	What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?	It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.	You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.	The why'd the police let him go?
The why'd the police let him go?	Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?	There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.	So what's his reason?
So what's his reason?	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.	She's saving herself for you.
She's saving herself for you.	Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?	I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?	Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...	Which is you...
Which is you...	So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.	And what would be your motive?
And what would be your motive?	It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I thought everything was checked out.	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.	I can cry on cue.
What's Leatherface doing here?	He came to make up.
He came to make up.	There goes my chance with Sid.
There goes my chance with Sid.	Like you had one.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?	Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."	Wanna another beer?
Wanna another beer?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I'll be right back.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.	Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.	No, Sid.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.	Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.	Yeah, okay... whatever.
Yeah, okay... whatever.	Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.	You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.	Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?	It's all part of the game.
You're crazy -- both of you.	The official term is "psychotic".
The official term is "psychotic".	You'll never get away with this.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?	Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Do you believe this shit?	What happened?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.	No way.
No way.	And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.	Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.	Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.	Do they know who did it?
Do they know who did it?	Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...	They think it's school-related?
They think it's school-related?	They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Or a man's mentality.	How do you gut someone?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.	No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.	Tell your mom I said thanks.
Tell your mom I said thanks.	Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?	Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.	I'll be there by seven. I promise
I'll be there by seven. I promise	Thanks, Tatum.
Thanks, Tatum.	Later.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.	It's past seven.
It's past seven.	Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.	I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.	Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.	Whatever. Just hurry.
Whatever. Just hurry.	Bye.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.	Just like old times, ain't it?
Just like old times, ain't it?	No, nothing's like it used to be.
Do you really think Billy did it?	He was there, Tatum.
He was there, Tatum.	I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
Come on, Sid.	Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.	But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.	I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Shit, what is he doing here?	I bet he's pissed.
I bet he's pissed.	Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...
I don't know...	Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.	So you think my mom was a slut too?
So you think my mom was a slut too?	I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.	If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?	You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.	Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.	It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.	And you believe it?
And you believe it?	Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.	Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.	You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.	Come on, let's rock.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?	Oh, god...
Is Billy going to be there tonight?	He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.	You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.	But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?	Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
What do you think about when you're having sex?	With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Who?	Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.

How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?	During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.	No way.
No way.	Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?	Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.	TATUM!
TATUM!	Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.	Deal.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?	I don't know, they just did.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.	That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I thought you dumped her for me.	I did. He's full of shit.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.	Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?	For once, Stu, drop it.
For once, Stu, drop it.	Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
That's mature.	Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.	Tits -- see.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.	What am I? The beer wench?
What am I? The beer wench?	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.	Give it to me.
Give it to me.	How's that?
How's that?	There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
That's not necessary.  You're in.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.	What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.	So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
You don't.  It goes to court now.	He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.	You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?	Ease back, Mills.
What do you think?	I'm in.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.	Announcing what?
Announcing what?	There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...	So what?  This victim...
So what?  This victim...	... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.	Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.	One is gluttony.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.	This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.	I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
You've left unfinished business before.	Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.
No, I haven't heard.	There was a second.
Already.	Greed.  It was written in blood.
It's none of my business anymore.	I thought you might want to be filled in.
I thought you might want to be filled in.	I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Good.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.	Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	You know.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.	I heard.
I heard.	I have no understanding of this place anymore.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.	It's always been like this.
It's always been like this.	Really?
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.	He's not finished.
How you feeling?	I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.	We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.	Yeah, that's true.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.	It would be too hard.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.	I read about it in the paper.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.	I'll see you.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.	Where was the girl?
Where was the girl?	What?  What?
What?  What?	Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.	Who tied her down?  You or him?
Who tied her down?  You or him?	He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!	Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Turn around.  Hands on your head!	What the hell's going on?
What the hell's going on?	Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?	I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.	Okay...
I don't believe it.	Hello.
What do you mean?	I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?	It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
What's so exciting?	It's not too far away now.
What time is it?	Why?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.	David... please...
David... please...	I visited your home this morning, after you left.
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
You didn't know.	NO!
Where we headed?	You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.	Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.	What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?	Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.	I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.	You know that's not true.
You know that's not true.	In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...	Spit it out.
Spit it out.	It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.	Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.	Oh, don't worry. You won't...
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?	Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.	You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.

That's all.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.	Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.

Murderers?	A woman...
A woman...	Murderers like you?
Murderers like you?	A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.

Delusions of grandeur.	You should be thanking me.
You should be thanking me.	And, why is that?
And, why is that?	You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.	We would have gotten you eventually.
We would have gotten you eventually.	Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.	I seem to remember knocking on your door.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.	And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.	Sit back.
Just keep leading the way.	It's close.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.	What the fuck is going on here?!
You've made a good life for yourself...	Shut up!
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck is going on?	I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Somerset...	Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.	Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...	Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.	I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?	I... I don't follow.
I... I don't follow.	All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.	I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
You just met me.	Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.	It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.	Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.

Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.	I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.	Not here.
Not here.	I realize that.
I realize that.	Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?	And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.	Drop it.
Drop it.	For now.
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.
No one yet.	Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...	Please be quiet for a while, would you?
There's a bucket here.	What?
What?	There's a bucket.  Under the table.
It's a bucket of vomit.	Is there any blood in it?
Is there any blood in it?	I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
You think it was poison?	Guessing at this point is useless.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?	No.
No.	Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.	Good.
Good.	The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.	I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.	Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
Is that clear?	Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...	I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Same color and texture.	Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
This doesn't make any sense.	You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
It could be nothing.	But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.	This was one sadistic motherfucker.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.	This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.	Whoa, whoa... what?!
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.	Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
It's my wife.	What?
Well?	I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.	How's that?
How's that?	Tonight.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.	Hello.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.	What about sports?
What about sports?	What about them?
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?
I read.  Remember reading?	I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"	I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.	I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.	Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.	All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?	He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
He must have left another puzzle piece.	Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...	This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.	And, if it's a threat.
And, if it's a threat.	We put her in a safe house.
He's preaching.	Punishing.
Punishing.	The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.	Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.	Did you read them?
Did you read them?	Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...	Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.	Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.	For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.	Forced what?
Forced what?	Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.	Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
No fingerprints?	Nothing.
Nothing.	Totally unrelated victims.
No witnesses of any kind?	None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
This is the one thing.	I know.
I know.	What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?	Okay.  But, what?
You're sure your men didn't move this?	Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Nothing.	It's got to be.
What the fuck is that?	A switchblade.
There must be something.	We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
What?	Bear with me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!	Just wait!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?	No.
He just may be nuts enough.	It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.	Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?	And you don't?
And you don't?	I wish I still thought like you.
I wish I still thought like you.	Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.	All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...	Oh, that's all.
Oh, that's all.	We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.

Bullshit.	I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.

I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.	In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.

The fingerprints.	Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.	We'll tag along.
Why would we?	Satisfy our curiosity?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?	Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.	And?
And?	It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
How did the fire fight end?	I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
How was it?	I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.

I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.

It is Victor.	Call an ambulance.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.	I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.	Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.

Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.

No.	Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.	No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.

And so what?	Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?	Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.

How much money do you have?	I don't know... like fifty.
Well, that was money well spent.	Let's go.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.	It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.

What are you going to say?	You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.	Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
Are you alright?	I'm fine.
I'm fine.	What happened?
Wait... just wait.	It was him.
It was him.	You can't go in there.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.	We need a warrant.
We need a warrant.	We have probable cause now.
Think about it...	What the fuck is wrong with you?

What are you talking about?	We had him.

Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.	Then, he must write about these murders.
Then, he must write about these murders.	"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended."
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.	Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
He's preaching.	These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.	Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.	One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.

Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.	Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.

No.	I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.	I will.
What is it?	Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.

I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.	I... I don't understand.

You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.	I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.	It surprises me.  It really does.
It surprises me.  It really does.	Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't know, with this case.	If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.	It's a hard place.

Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.	I want to have children.  It's just...

Crime of passion.	Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.	This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.

What, Ben?	I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?	Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.

Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?	Huh...? No...no water.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.	It was, I tell you!

This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.	Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?	No sir...pleasure.
No sir...pleasure.	In that case, give the boys room...
You all right, sergeant?	Dunno...Seems so.
Dunno...Seems so.	Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...	Yes sir...
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.	I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
You ain't goin'...	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.	Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?	I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.	Got a warrant?
Got a warrant?	You fit a lot of descriptions.
You fit a lot of descriptions.	I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
He cometh forth like a...	Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!	...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
What good does that do?	By what you preach...none!
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.	You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?	I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...	...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!	Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
You got any more orders, Captain?	Just keep goin'...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.	How far's the river from here, Mose?
I didn't give any order to fire!	That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...	You got one now!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?	Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.	This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?	<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.	How many, would you say?
How many, would you say?	Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.	There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.	Now mount up, son...
I say NO!	Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
What in...?	Captain Clayton...Captain!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??	Sir?
Sir?	Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?	Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...	Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
If there's anything I can do, sir...	God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...	But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?	All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...	Yes, sir...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?	I'm Clayton.
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...	Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?	Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.	Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?	My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.	JOINT action?
JOINT action?	Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?	Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...	But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...	Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!	Grab hold!...
Unnt-meah!	We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...	They have done...nothing...They are my people...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...	You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...	Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?	I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...	I've come now...
I've come now...	These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ay-eh...They was here...	SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...	Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.	Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...	You were born old...
Well, the reward still stands...	Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...	You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...	Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?	Told ya, didn't I?
Told ya, didn't I?	Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.	Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...	Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...	Scar! Where's he holed in?
Scar! Where's he holed in?	Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
How'd you come by this?	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.	That's what I said.
That's what I said.	You got it with you?
Talk!	A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...	Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.	Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.	Keep talking.
Keep talking.	Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.	And maybe you lie...
And maybe you lie...	In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.	Ain't yours yet.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...	<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...	Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?	Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!	That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.	You've done a lot of growin'...
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...	Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
What you want me to call you?	Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?	Well, fust off...
Well, come on!	Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Nothing for you to see.	Leggo...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...	Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...	If they're still alive...
Easy on that!	Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...	They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
You want us to fire a shot if...	No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
You all right, Ethan?	Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?	Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
What you goin' to do?	Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Say it. We're beat!	No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
And you think we got a chance to find her?	An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Good night...Laurie...	Good night...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...	YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...	I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...	Why?
Why?	Because she's my...my...
Because she's my...my...	She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!	I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...	That don't make 'em kin...
That don't make 'em kin...	All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.	How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...	Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!	Good night.
Hey! What's the idea...?	Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...	What's that?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...	Oh...
Oh...	You all settled an' comfortable now?
Futterman?	He just couldn't wait...
He just couldn't wait...	Whatchu doin'?...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...	Scar?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.	But I just bought a good blanket.
But I just bought a good blanket.	Forget it...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...	Think it might be...?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!	What?
What?	You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!	Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...	And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...	Cut it out, will ya...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...	Look?
You ask her!	Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...	She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.	Think she means for us to follow?
Think she means for us to follow?	How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
I think maybe we oughta...	Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Ethan, quit it!	Nine...  Ten!
Nine...  Ten!	What's the sense in it!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.	Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....	Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
Well, you're a widower now...	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
No...She's not...	I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Lemme alone...	You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.	Never heard of him...
Never heard of him...	Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Stay out here.	Not likely.
You figger Scar means to kill us?	He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.	Why didn't he make his move back there?
Why didn't he make his move back there?	I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
How? She's even forgot her own language!	Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...	Over there!
They'll be back...	We won't be here...Come on!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...	Not no more.
Not no more.	You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.	She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.	It's what I'm countin' on.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...	Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...	She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...	You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Was your niece about their age?	Not far from it...
Not far from it...	Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...	They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...	There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?	Comancheros...
Comancheros...	That's the breed...Course it might take time.
That's the breed...Course it might take time.	Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.	I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.	I got your boy killed.
I got your boy killed.	Don't go blamin' yourself...
Why it's just a snip of calico...	You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?	Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?	No...not yet...
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!...She's alive?
You've seen her!...She's alive?	I've seen her...and she's alive.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...	From the beginning...
From the beginning...	'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...	Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.	Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?	That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!	A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
They never find that girl.	Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Don't go takin' that stuff...	Ain't worth the mendin'...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?	Well I ain't one of 'em!
Well I ain't one of 'em!	I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...	You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...	Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
Might at least have left me my pants!	Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...	Finish your breakfast...
Finish your breakfast...	I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!	Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...	But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...	One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...	It wasn't much of a letter...
It wasn't much of a letter...	No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...	But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...	It isn't fair...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...	You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.	You crazy?
You crazy?	It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...	I got to fetch her home...
I got to fetch her home...	Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...	<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!	Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!	Only if I'm dead!
She'd be about thirteen now...	We got two around that age...
We got two around that age...	Where?
Where?	You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...	But couldn't you...?
But couldn't you...?	Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Why else?	Come on, say it.  You know...
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?	"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I have to cut his windpipe...	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!	What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Ellen, move aside...	Oh God, Tommi...
Stop that!	You'll never get away from me!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?	They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?	Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.	Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?	It still worked in town.
It still worked in town.	I mean the armchair!
I mean the armchair!	Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Maybe the antenna's broken.	We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Hey... the fuse.	Oh, damnit!
Do you know where fuse box is?	In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.	We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.	Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!	Do you have a better idea?
Do you have a better idea?	I'll do it myself.
I'll do it myself.	You?
You?	My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?	My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.	Yes, daddy.
Where are you going?	Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
What are you doing?	Making our very own solstice fire.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?	I just had a really strange experience.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.	Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?	We just have to make a new beginning.
We just have to make a new beginning.	Cherry-red Tears.
Cherry-red Tears.	What?
What?	Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.	Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.	I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.	And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I miss Tommi so much.	So do I, believe me.
So do I, believe me.	Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?	Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.	If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Who was that?	Someone from the village.
Martin, it's not funny!	You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!	Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?	Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
So, did you sleep good?	Yeah... I have to go to town.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.	No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?	Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Where have you been all day?	I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?	Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Where have you been?	In the village.  Look what I found.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."	Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?	What? What am I supposed to sense?
What? What am I supposed to sense?	The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
Who's that?	I haven't the slightest idea.
What?	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
She was old.	Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.	Maybe an animal.
Maybe an animal.	An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?	Hi, darling.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?	This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.	Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?	Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
Martin, what-	It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.	Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?	What are you talking about-
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.	We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.	'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
It's important - he knows the last chapter.	Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.	...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
What?	I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
How did you get me out of there?	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?	You don't remember?
Ellen.	You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.	Thank you.
I really hate to bother him, but...	Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.	Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?	But what is the truth?
But what is the truth?	I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Hello.  Can I help you?	Does this dog here belong to you?
No, I've never seen him before.	You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Ellen Straub.	It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?	Do I look like it that much?
Do I look like it that much?	Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.	Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.	1976.  What happened back then?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.	I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!	There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
And that is?	A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Mrs. Straub!	I've killed my husband!
I've killed my husband!	What?
What?	I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...	We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?	Just call me Elisabeth.
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.	Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
You didn't tell her!	We should leave the past alone.
We should leave the past alone.	Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...	Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?	Yes, something was...
Hammer?	How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Well, look here!	Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?	Tenth floor.
Tenth floor.	Very funny.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.	I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Twenty-three, to be exact.	I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?	Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona	And the title of this piece?
And the title of this piece?	Mercutio
WillWhere is Mercutio?	Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
You did not like the speech?	The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
NedI knowI know	It's good.
It's good.	Oh
Oh	The title won't do.
The title won't do.	Ah
Ah	Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.

You are a gentleman.	And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Ohwhat have I done?	He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Follow that boat!	Right you are, governor!
I know your face. Are you an actor?	Yes.
Yes.	Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.	Really?
Really?	I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Do you know that house?	Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.	Writer, is he?
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?
Lady?	Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.

Yes, I saw it.	Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.	By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.	That's me.
That's me.	And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.

Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!	The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.	Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!	Nobody knew!
It is over.	I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.

No.	Come on, David.
Come on, David.	No.
No.	Juliet?
You mean immoral.	I'm only asking you both to think about it.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.	It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.	But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.	You think so?
You think so?	All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.
He couldn't get his car started.	When are you going to let the police know?
When are you going to let the police know?	You call them if you want.
You call them if you want.	And what about you?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.	A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.	So who's going to do it?
So who's going to do it?	Dig the pit, I don't know.
Dig the pit, I don't know.	No, not that.
No, not that.	Then what? Who's going to do what?
Then what? Who's going to do what?	You know what I'm talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.	Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?	You know what. Who's going to do it.
You know what. Who's going to do it.	We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?	I can't do it.
I can't do it.	I don't hear this.
I don't hear this.	I won't be able to.
I won't be able to.	You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.	I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.	I just thought we should discuss it.
I just thought we should discuss it.	Take his legs.
I don't know.	Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Finished.	But not quite.
But not quite.	Is that going to be deep enough?
Don't you worry about that.	Is this necessary?
Is this necessary?	Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
That was good.	Can we talk about something?
Can we talk about something?	Not now. I have an idea.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --	Just stop worrying.
What's the problem?	I want to talk now.
I want to talk now.	After you drink to love and happiness forever.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.	Now.
Now.	After.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?	Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.	You think so?
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
I don't know.	How much did you pay?
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
I don't know.	How much?
How much?	I don't know.
What is this?	Security.
Security.	From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?	There was a break-in.
There was a break-in.	Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
Doesn't it worry you?	No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What's all this for, more security?	I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.	Oh, that'll come in useful.
What? Yes, that's fine.	You're sure? There's lots more.
You're sure? There's lots more.	No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.	What's wrong?
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Nothing.	You're not eating.
You're not eating.	Not eating what?
Not eating what?	Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.	If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
I want to secure it.	Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
You looking for me?	Looking for you? Yes.
Looking for you? Yes.	What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?	We just wanted to speak to you.
Who?	Your friends.
Your friends.	I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.	It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.	I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.	I beg your pardon?
But they know.	They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --	They know.
They know.	They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.	Except the money.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.	Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.	You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.	So I gathered.
So I gathered.	Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.	It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.	No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.	Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.	For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.	Not at all.
Not at all.	I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?	Yeah?
Yeah?	But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.	About the mail --
About the mail --	It's very kind of you to offer, but --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --	Where do you think you'll go?
Where do you think you'll go?	Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
What?	I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.	Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.	I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it.	Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.	Cover it?
Cover it?	Well?
Well?	But there's no --
But there's no --	Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.	I don't know.
I don't know.	Don't know what?
Don't know what?	Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Is this being recorded?	This is just an informal discussion.
This is just an informal discussion.	Are you recording it?
Are you recording it?	What does it look like?
What does it look like?	It looks like he's writing everything down.
It looks like he's writing everything down.	That's because he is. Does that upset you?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?	No. Why should it?
No. Why should it?	Well, then?
Well, then?	I've never seen any of these men before.
I've never seen any of these men before.	Take another look at these two.
Take another look at these two.	I don't know them.
I don't know them.	And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?	Yes, I suppose so.
Well, is it?	What?
What?	Parked outside?
Parked outside?	No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's it, then.	That's all?
That's all?	Sorry to waste your time.
Sorry to waste your time.	Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.	Just one thing.
Just one thing.	Yes.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.	I see.
Right.	Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
That's right.	What?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?	Yes, thanks.
Yes, thanks.	Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?	Yes.
Yes.	And you like it?
And you like it?	Oh, yes, it's great.
Oh, yes, it's great.	Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?	Yes.
Yes.	Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.	Well, yes.
Well, yes.	So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
What?	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Cameron.	Cameron?
Cameron?	Yes.
Yes.	Really?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?	I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?	Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?	OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Did you know --	Just serve.
I thought you stopped going.	Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.	Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.	For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.	For the flat.
For the flat.	No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.	She hated you --
She hated you --	Well, she had problems --
Well, she had problems --	-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.	-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.	He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Who was it?	I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
So we'll meet him, then?	What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Aroused and inflamed.	Alex.
Alex.	He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
I'm not usually drunk.	Not usually this drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --	It was you, Juliet, it was you --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --	-- instead of what he is --
-- instead of what he is --	What I am.
What I am.	-- which is --
-- which is --	-- which is a hack.
-- which is a hack.	The man we know and love.
The man we know and love.	A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.	Know and love?
Know and love?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I think you're lying.
I think you're lying.	You're right.
You're right.	You see, they don't really know me.
You see, they don't really know me.	No, Alex, we don't really love you.
Have you seen Hugo?	No. Any idea which channel he's on?
David hasn't seen him either.	So I gathered.
So I gathered.	Maybe he didn't like us.
Maybe he didn't like us.	David?
David?	Hugo.
Hugo.	His car's still there.
His car's still there.	He's got a car?
He's got a car?	So what's wrong with that?
So what's wrong with that?	What sort of car?
What sort of car?	Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.	I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --	A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.	Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.	So?
So?	Open it.
Open it.	You want me to kick it open?
You want me to kick it open?	Yes.
Yes.	Now?
Now?	Yes.
Yes.	All right. No problem.
I wonder how he did it?	Did what?
Did what?	I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Alex.	What? What's wrong?
What? What's wrong?	What are you doing?
What are you doing?	I'm just looking.
I'm just looking.	Don't.
Don't.	Don't look?
Don't look?	No.
No.	Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?	No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?	It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.	Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.	Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
No, Alex. It's, it's --	What?
What?	Unfeasible.
Unfeasible.	Is that all?
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
I thought we all were.	I don't thinkI can.
I don't thinkI can.	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.	I don't want to. It's different.
I don't want to. It's different.	And now you tell me.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.	OK.
OK.	David?
Be careful.	Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?	Stop nagging.
Stop nagging.	I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Sshh.	I want my money back. Excuse me.
Love and happiness for ever.	For ever and ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.	It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.	Who?
Who?	Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.	No, I don't.
No, I don't.	What's he doing here?
What's he doing here?	That's not him.
That's not him.	Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.	You were magnificent.
Hello. Hello.	Who was it?
Who was it?	Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.	Are you all right?
Are you all right?	No.
No.	Then let's spend some money.
Will you calm down.	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.
No, no, it's different.	I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	It tastes different.
It tastes different.	I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.	He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.	Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.	You know we're right.
You know we're right.	Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.	Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Leave him alone.	He can't stay up there.
He can't stay up there.	He'll come down. Leave him alone.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.	Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?	No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?	Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	We have to talk.
We have to talk.	Your painful groin?
Later. But first -- him.	David?
David?	Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --	Oh, good.
Oh, good.	He won't do anything for me, but for you --
He won't do anything for me, but for you --	Forget it.
Forget it.	He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.	And the money?
And the money?	We could put it somewhere.
We could put it somewhere.	Where he can't get it?
Where he can't get it?	Now you thought of that, not me.
Now you thought of that, not me.	Forget it -- he'll come down.
Expecting anyone?	No.
No.	Oh.
Aren't you going to answer it?	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.	It's the only way.
It's the only way.	I refuse.
I refuse.	You're frightened.
You're frightened.	No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You'll wait in the hall?	I'll wait there.
I'll wait there.	And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?	Everything.
Everything.	Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.	Alex.
Alex.	What?
What?	As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Are you all right?	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --	We were just sorting things out.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --	Oh, shut up, Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.	That's what I thought he said.
It's about me and David.	The perfect couple, I should say.
The perfect couple, I should say.	You mustn't take it so badly.
You mustn't take it so badly.	Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.	Don't you ever stop?
Don't you ever stop?	No.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.	Let him go. Let him take it all.
Interesting.	I see.
I see.	Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
So, uh...	What?
What?	What?
What?	You were going to say something.
You were going to say something.	What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?
You mean I can have the room?	Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Can you afford this place?	Yeah.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.	What about?
What about?	It's about the burglary.
It's about the burglary.	Burglary?
Burglary?	Downstairs.
Downstairs.	Of course.
Of course.	Can we come in?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.	did you hear anything before he cries?
did you hear anything before he cries?	No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.	Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?	No, nothing, sorry.
No, nothing, sorry.	Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?	Of course.
Of course.	And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?	There are only two other people in the flat.
Two?	Who said there were four?
Who said there were four?	We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.	No, three. Who said there were four?
No, three. Who said there were four?	How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?	Yes, absolutely.
Yes, absolutely.	Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
I see.	I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?	No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.	Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?	I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.	Someone lost the key.
Is this where no one stays?	Yeah, that's right, that's it.
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.
You're sure of that.	Yes.
Yes.	That wasn't a question.
Why do you want a room here?	Do you smoke?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.	OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.	Did you ever kill a man?
Just get on with it, Alex.	Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.

Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --	Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference.

Why not?	I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.	What?
What?	These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
She's got a...	Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?	Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think so.	That's very serious. Who's her doctor?

Why do you wanna know so bad?	See if you've been making it with my mother.
See if you've been making it with my mother.	What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?	Have you ever made it with a girl?
Have you ever made it with a girl?	I asked you first.
I asked you first.	Yeah... I've made it with a girl...

Right.	And you need money?
And you need money?	Right, that's right.
Right, that's right.	You do know what money's like these days.
You do know what money's like these days.	Well, yeah... you know.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.	They are?
They are?	After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.	I guess not...
I guess not...	It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
What sort of references do you have?	Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.	Pardon me?
Pardon me?	Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.	I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.	Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?

You promised you'd do the show.	Oh fuck, Norman!
Oh fuck, Norman!	Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You're late, George.	Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
What!	Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.	You do it.
You do it.	Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.

I'm sure.	He's a very private person, actually.
He's a very private person, actually.	Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
-- Well no. It never came up.	You going to tell him?
You going to tell him?	-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?	No, thanks.
No, thanks.	Well, I do.
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.
Probably the bathroom.	Can't you do it out here?
Well, what do you think?	I'd cut it...
I'd cut it...	You would?
You would?	Yeah, I think so...
Yeah, I think so...	You don't seem very sure.

Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...	Did Lester know about him?
Did Lester know about him?	There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.

That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --	C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.

Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.	Well, yeah.
Well, yeah.	She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.	Thank you.
Thank you.	I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.	I see.
It's an unusual trade.	Yes it is.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.	In a way. But...
In a way. But...	But what?
But what?	I'm better than the guy I work for.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.	After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's good you want to do something, George.	Thank you.
Thank you.	But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.	They're not?

No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?	You're right.
You're right.	Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?	Sure.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?	Oh yeah.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.	Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.	So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
When?	When?
Tonight?	Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.	Okay.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.	Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?	-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.	I know what you mean.
Sorry, honey, I...	That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.

... this doing hair it's...	I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.	Oh, hey...
Oh, hey...	It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --	I don't know what to...
I don't know what to...	Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --	-- yeah?
-- yeah?	See she doesn't drink too much.
Well anyway...	Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?	Isn't that bad for it?
Isn't that bad for it?	No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
This really ought to be layered...	Layered?
Layered?	Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
You live like a pig.	Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?	All night.
All night.	Well... who are those guys?
Well... who are those guys?	What do they look like?...
What do they look like?...	Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?	Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.	Well, what?
Well, what?	Godammit, George...
Godammit, George...	Now wait a minute...
Now wait a minute...	Sit down.
Sit down.	But...
But...	I said sit down!
I wanna hear about it.	Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it, George.	Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.	I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.	What can I say!
What can I say!	I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!	I'm not anti-Establishment.
I'm not anti-Establishment.	That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.	Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.	No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Was it me, did you have something against me?	What, do you think I planned it?
What, do you think I planned it?	Did they have something against me?
Did they have something against me?	Didn't they tell you?
Didn't they tell you?	I wanna hear it from you!
I wanna hear it from you!	... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.	We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?	Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...	Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.	Why, why do you think that is?
Why, why do you think that is?	Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?	Well, I don't know.
Want a drink?	No thanks.
No thanks.	Have a drink.
Have a drink.	Okay, thanks.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.
I know.	I'll have to wash one out.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.	Who?
Who?	Me!
Me!	Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.	I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!	Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...	Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.	I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.	What about Jackie?
What about Jackie?	What about her?
What about her?	I mean, how did that happen?
I mean, how did that happen?	Lester, it just happened.
Lester, it just happened.	She's nothing but a whore.
She's nothing but a whore.	No --
No --	Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.	No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
You really think so?	Yes I do.
Yes I do.	I'm finished with her.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.	What?
What?	Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
What took you so long?	Wasn't sure it was you.
Wasn't sure it was you.	
	I... uh... I... uh... can't.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.	All right, who're you with? Jill?

I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.	Okay.
Okay.	
	Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.	A soap?
A soap?	A daytime soap opera.
A daytime soap opera.	And?
And?	I was too old.
I was too old.	What was it, somebody's daughter?
What was it, somebody's daughter?	Somebody's mother.
Well maybe I can get you something.	That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.	Sid.
Sid.	Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.	Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.	You do?
You do?	Yes.
Yes.	-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.	How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.	Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.	Is that right?
Is that right?	Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.	Is that right?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.	George is going to open a shop.
George is going to open a shop.	No kidding? Your own shop?
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.	I am?
I am?	Who were you talking to?
Who were you talking to?	Who do you think I was talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?	My secretary saw you with that boy.
My secretary saw you with that boy.	Steve?
Steve?	Whatever his name is, that actor.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.	Then you were talking to him.
Then you were talking to him.	I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.	I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.	So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!	Of course not.
Of course not.	That's not very logical, Lester.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...	Really? How about starting with tonight?
You and your touchy investors.	Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.	What's that?
What's that?	You're still jealous.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?	Fine.
Shut the door, shut the door!	Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd like a drink.	Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.	You ought to get rid of those dogs.
They get hair all over the place.	They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?
Aren't you going to have one?	No.
No.	Why not?
Why not?	Because I don't want one.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.	Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.	Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Who are they?	Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.	Does she know about us?
Does she know about us?	Jesus, she's my best friend.
Jesus, she's my best friend.	Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?	I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?	C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Hi, doll, what's wrong?	You know what's wrong.
Jackie Shawn.	Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
-- you phony asshole --	Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Hi, Leonard.	Jackie, what're you doing?
Jackie, what're you doing?	Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?	I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Poster-Kleiser.	Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?	That's right.
That's right.	I'll call you.
I'll call you.	Fine.
Fine.	See you later.
See you later.	Anyway, you're crazy.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.	Who is that?
Who is that?	A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I am? I mean why?	Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.	I'm not. Maybe I am.
I'm not. Maybe I am.	No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Well, he is.	So what's your point?
So what's your point?	Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.	I know, I'm sorry.
I know, I'm sorry.	I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?

Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?	George is great but I know what you mean.
George is great but I know what you mean.	Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.	I guess not.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?	Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.	You're really a love -- you sure?
You're really a love -- you sure?	-- No. No really.
-- No. No really.	Well, what is it, honey?
Well, what is it, honey?	Nothing.
Nothing.	It must be something.
It must be something.	Well, it's George.
Well, it's George.	I thought you said things were great with George.
I thought you said things were great with George.	Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?	We don't think marriage is important.
We don't think marriage is important.	But you have problems?
But you have problems?	-- Yeah, honey...
-- Yeah, honey...	I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Five times a day?	-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.	Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?	Well, you know what I mean.
Well, you know what I mean.	After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.	I'm exaggerating.
I'm exaggerating.	How much?
How much?	Jackie --
Jackie --	What?
What?	Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.	He does?
He does?	Well yes -- you know that about George.
Well yes -- you know that about George.	It's been so long I don't how long?
It's been so long I don't how long?	Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?	I would say so, yes.
I would say so, yes.	Honey?
Honey?	What?
What?	I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?	-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?	-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.	-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.	C'mon.
C'mon.	Well, there was this one time --
Well, there was this one time --	-- Yesss?
-- Yesss?	-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...	-- uhh-huhh...
-- uhh-huhh...	-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...	... Mmm-hmmm.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...	Didn't you have any panties on?
Didn't you have any panties on?	-- He reached up and tore them.
-- He reached up and tore them.	What did you do?
What did you do?	Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.	No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?	No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Egypt?	That's right.
That's right.	But why Egypt?
But why Egypt?	Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.	Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Oh. thank you.	Sure.
Why don't you ask for another one?	Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.	... my friend doesn't like it here either.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.	All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.	Well he's not exactly a friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.	Is he an enemy?
Is he an enemy?	Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.	-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- sort of a boyfriend?	Sort of.
Sort of.	I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.	Johnny!
Johnny!	My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
I'm terribly sorry.	-- never mind.
-- never mind.	What does he do? Is he an actor?
What does he do? Is he an actor?	-- no.
-- no.	Good for you.
Good for you.	He's a hairdresser.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?	Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?	Not with your hairdresser.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?	Well... sure...
Well... sure...	Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
George? Was he alone?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	Well did he go in there with Jackie?
That bastard.	George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --	-- oh I don't know --
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.	Let's do that.
-- why?	-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?	Of course not.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?	You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.	Two weeks from tomorrow.
Two weeks from tomorrow.	You're going?
You're going?	You're going.
You're kidding.	Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.	Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?	-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.	-- he'll never know the difference.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.	I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- what's the problem, honey?	-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- his car. They have it blocked.	Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.	Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- I'll get in the back --	-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...	-- there's not much room --
-- there's not much room --	That's fine --

Jill.	Jill.

Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.	Thank you.
Thank you.	-- just wonderful.
You seem disappointed.	No... how long did you say?
No... how long did you say?	Three weeks.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.	No, it's not that...
No, it's not that...	Do you have children?
Do you have children?	No.

We'll let you know tomorrow.	Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.	Thanks for coming by.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.	Have they sat down?
Have they sat down?	Everybody but us.
No of course not.	-- we're going to be here all night.
Everything okay, son?	Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Call me Les.	Where to, Les?
Where to, Les?	Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.	Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Dad?	Yes?
Yes?	I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.	Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.	What was the Donner party?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.	You mean they ate each other up?
You mean they ate each other up?	They had to, in order to survive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Come here for a minute, first.
How's it going, Doc?	Okay.
Are you having a good time?	Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.	Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.	I am, Dad.  Dad?
I am, Dad.  Dad?	Yes.
Yes.	Do you feel bad?
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?
Then why don't you go to sleep?	I can't.  I have too much to do.
I can't.  I have too much to do.	Dad?
Dad?	Yes?
Yes?	Do you like this hotel?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?	I guess so.
I guess so.	Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Dad?	What?
What?	You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?	What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?	No, Dad.
No, Dad.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?	Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.	Good.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?	No.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?	French Fries and Ketchup.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?	Yeah.
Chocolate.	Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.
I'm not supposed to.	Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who says you ain't supposed to?	Tony.
Tony.	Who's Tony?
Who's Tony?	Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.	Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Yes.	How does he tell you things?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.	Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?	Yes.
Yes.	Do they know he tell you things?
I don't know.	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Maybe he showed me something.	Try to think what it was.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.	Is there something bad here?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.	Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.	Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.	What about Room 237?
What about Room 237?	Room 237?
Room 237?	You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
No I ain't.	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?	Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Yeah.	Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?	Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.	Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.	What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?	Okay.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?	Okay, Mom.
Okay, Mom.	Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack...	Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.	Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.	Okay.  You behave yourself.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?	All right.
All right.	And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?	Okay...oh!
Okay...oh!	Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.
It's so pretty.	Yeah.
Yeah.	I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?	No.
Mom?	Yes?
Yes?	Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.	I won't make any noise.
I won't make any noise.	Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?	I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.	I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?	Okay, Mom.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.	Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny?	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.	Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?	Red Rum.
Red Rum.	Are you having a bad dream?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Mommy...	Danny, come here!
Danny, come here!	Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy... Mommy...!	Danny!
Mommy!	Oh!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?	No.
No.	Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?	Yes.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?	Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?	Talking to Tony.
Talking to Tony.	Is Tony one of your animals?
Is Tony one of your animals?	No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Oh,	if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?	No.
No.	Why not?
Why not?	Because he hides.
Because he hides.	Where does he go?
Where does he go?	To my stomach.
To my stomach.	Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?	Do I have to?
Do I have to?	Yes, I'd like you to.
Shall we go into the living room?	Yes.
Please...	Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
But eh what was the matter with him?	Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?	Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.	Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Tony.	Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?	No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
What sort of injury did he have?	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
How did he manage to do that?	Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.	Well how can I repay you?
Well how can I repay you?	It's okay, really.
It's okay, really.	Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?	Sure.
Sure.	Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.	Advocaat is it?
Advocaat is it?	Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.	Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.	Fine.
Grady?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Delbert Grady.
Delbert Grady.	That's right, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.	And, er... where are they now?
And, er... where are they now?	Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
No.	He is, Mr. Torrance.
He is, Mr. Torrance.	Who?
Who?	A nigger.
A nigger.	A nigger!
A nigger!	A nigger cook.
How?	Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.	Well, he is a very willful boy.
She eh... interferes.	Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.	Grady... oh.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.	Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.	Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.	For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.	There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.	You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening.  Forest Service.	Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.	Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?	Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.	All right, sir.
Good evening.  Forest Service.	Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.	Sure.
Sure.	This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.	Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.	It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.	No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.	Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?	I'm a Wendy.
I'm a Wendy.	Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.	God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?	Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.	I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.	Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Beg pardon?	Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.	I did?
I did?	Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?	Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
No, we don't mind.	Good.
Good.	Sound good to you, Danny?
Bill, how do you do?	Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.	Pleasure to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.	What line of work are you in now?
What line of work are you in now?	I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.	Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.	Well, I'm looking for a change.
What'll it be?	Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?	Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.	That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.	Thank you for saying so.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?	Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.	I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.	Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.	Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to see you.	It's good to be back, Lloyd.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.	What'll it be, sir?
No charge?	Your money's no good here.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.	It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hi, babe.	Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Hi, hon.  How's it going?	Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.	Uh...huh.
Sure is.	God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Perfect for a child.	Yeah.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.	What time is it?
What time is it?	It's about eleven thirty.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!	I guess we've been staying up too late.
I guess we've been staying up too late.	I know it.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.	Hmm, nice.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?	Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.	Yeah... that's all it is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.	Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
What do you want me to do about it?	Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.	Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.	Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?	Yes.
Yes.	Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?	Yes.
Yes.	Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.	It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.	I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.	Which room was it?
Did you find anything?	No, nothing at all.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?	Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.	And you didn't see anything at all?
And you didn't see anything at all?	Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
He's still asleep.	Good.
Somebody did that to him.	I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?	Yes.
Yes.	You mean just leave the hotel?
You mean just leave the hotel?	Yes.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?	Jack...
Jack...	Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
Jack!	How do you like it?
I...	I can't really remember.
I can't really remember.	You can't remember.
I don't know.	I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	Yes...
Yes...	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.	Jack...
Of course I am.	Of course you are.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?	Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?	Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Stay away from me!	Why?
Why?	I just want to go back to my room.
I just want to go back to my room.	Why?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me,	Wendy!
Wendy!	Stay away...!
Stay away...!	Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.	Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...	Stop swinging the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.	Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.	Put the bat down, Wendy.
Put the bat down, Wendy.	Stop it!
Stop it!	Wendy give me the bat.
Wendy give me the bat.	Stay... stay away!
Stay... stay away!	Give me the bat.
Stay away from me.	Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.	Jack, stay away from me!
Jack, stay away from me!	Stop swinging the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.	Get down.
Give me the bat.	Go away from me.
Wendy...	Go away.
Go away.	Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.	Go away.
Go away.	Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.	Wendy...
Wendy...	I'm gonna go now.
I'm gonna go now.	Wendy...
Mr. Ullman?	Yes?
Yes?	I'm Jack Torrance.
I'm Jack Torrance.	Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Very nice to meet you.	Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Have any trouble finding us?	Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.	Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?	Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.	Susie.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.	Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.	Oh, it sure would be
Only in a very general way.	Well...
Well...	...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.

And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.	Well, that sounds fine to me.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.	Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
five months of peace is just what I want.	That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...	can of itself be a problem.
can of itself be a problem.	Not for me.
Not for me.	How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?	They'll love it.
They'll love it.	Great...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.	I'm intrigued.
I'm intrigued.	I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
I don't believe they did.	Well, my predecessor in this job
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are	shut in together over long periods of time.
shut in together over long periods of time.	Well, that is eh quite a story.
Well, obviously some people can be	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.	Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.	No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?	No, my son's discovered the games room.
No, my son's discovered the games room.	Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Right there.	Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
I'd better collect my family first.	Oh...
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.	Well, it's very... homely.
This is our Colorado Lounge.	Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.	Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.	Royalty?
Royalty?	All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.	Oh!
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.	Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.	Oh, I'll say.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.	Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thanks.	Thank you, Susie.
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	How're you getting on?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.	Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.	Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?	Yes.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.	How do you do?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.	Fine.
Fine.	Jack is a schoolteacher.
What time does the plane leave?	Eight thirty.
Eight thirty.	Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.	Fine.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!	Uncle Al-
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
Lowe's car-?	Blue. This blue.
Blue. This blue.	Jesus.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Can I tell you kids something?	Sure, Uncle Al.
Sure, Uncle Al.	When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
The moon's not down yet...	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.	Brady's a booger and so are you!
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
What's the money for?	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?	I don't want your money. You're a booger.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?	What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?	Stop it!
Yes. Go away.	Let me help you up.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.	Where's Mom?
Where's Mom?	Went shopping. Why?
Went shopping. Why?	Jane, I have to talk to you.
Jane... you don't have to do that.	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.	Will you marry me, Jane?
Please, Uncle Al.	Will you?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!	Jane-
Are you all right, Marty?	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.	You're a real booger, you know it?
You booger.	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.	What's that?
What's that?	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.	For getting a divorce?
For getting a divorce?	Well... it is his third.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
There's something else scary.	What?
I've been hearing noises in there.	What kind of noises?
What kind of noises?	Rattling. Rustling.
Rattling. Rustling.	Rats...
Rats...	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Mom-!	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
You all right, Marty?	Yeah.
Yeah.	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?	No.
No.	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?	Huh?
Huh?	What if it's some kind of monster?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...	It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.	Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.	Don't call me dear boy.
Don't call me dear boy.	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.	What?
What?	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?	Do I need one?
Do I need one?	We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.	I don't get you.
I don't get you.	I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?	Sure.
Sure.	Good.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.	Yeah! What is it?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.	Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah, I know. It's great!	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?	Yeah... sure.
Yeah... sure.	Save this one for last.
What is it?	A tracer. You'll like it.
A tracer. You'll like it.	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!	I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.	Was it a prescription?
Was it a prescription?	What the hell does that matter?
What the hell does that matter?	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!	Well... was it a prescription?
Well... was it a prescription?	I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!	You want to know what I think?
You want to know what I think?	No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.	Marty, do you see your suspect?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.	I told you!
I told you!	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.	I told you!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.	There! You see!
There! You see!	It could have been anything, Marty.
It could have been anything, Marty.	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?	No.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!	And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.	You're not going to let it go, are you?
You're not going to let it go, are you?	I saw what I saw.
I saw what I saw.	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.	The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.	I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.	Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.	Will you do it?
Yeah? Really?	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.	But Uncle Al! You said-
But Uncle Al! You said-	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
What if I say no?	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!	We won't!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!	If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.	I will- be good, kids.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.	Oh?
Oh?	I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.	Well... thank you.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.	Perhaps.
Perhaps.	I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.	Really?
Really.	Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.	Well... yes.  Yes it is.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?	Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?	What about crack?  You a user?
What about crack?  You a user?	I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?	We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
How come?  Sister?	Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?	'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.	Probation?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.	And you listen to that?
And you listen to that?	No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.	Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.	What you do?
What you do?	Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
How are you doing.	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?	You know it.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.	Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
His ashes?	With love.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.	Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?	What?
What?	You can handle this.
Okay, Christy -- strip.	What?
What?	That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?	What did who say?
What did who say?	Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
You are so damn sexy.	Vince...
Vince...	How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?	Today was the deadline, Vince.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.	You did what?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.	You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?	He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
What? 	You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?	You bastard!
You bastard!	We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.	You pig!
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!	You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
No... it's fine.	Yes?
Yes?	Thanks.  A lot.
Thanks.  A lot.	Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?	Sure.
Sure.	And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.	Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.	Good evening, Vincent.
Good evening, Vincent.	What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?	I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.	I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.	Joey -- do it.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!	That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh, girls.	Yes, Betty?
Yes, Betty?	This prom is a real drag.
This prom is a real drag.	Oh-huh.
Oh-huh.	Oh my! 
Oh my! 	What is it, Betty?
What is it, Betty?	Look at that.  Get a gander.
Look at that.  Get a gander.	Oh my! 
Oh my! 	He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...	Yes, Betty?
Yes, Betty?	HE'S SO FINE.
HE'S SO FINE.	D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.	WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?	Right.
Where did that come from?	I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.	No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?	Not in years.
Not in years.	Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.	Why?
Why?	To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.	But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.	Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.	Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.

Just about.  Show me again.	You betcha.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.	I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Is this... choir practice?	Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Hold on.	Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.	Chops?
Chops?	The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
Two days.  An hour or so.	No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
That machine.	I know.  It's ancient.
I know.  It's ancient.	It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?	The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE	Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?	Am I?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."	So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE	Because we're
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.	And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
What is it, Mary?	That man -- who is he?
Jackpot!  Two buckets	This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.

Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.	Enough jabber.
What?	Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.	Like this place?
Like this place?	I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Shirelles.	You know that song?
Soprano or alto?	Whatever.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?	Um, I don't really know this one...
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.	Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.	What?
What?	You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.	Mary Robert.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.	I knew that.
I knew that.	Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.	I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.	Wet behind the ears.
Wet behind the ears.	A bunch of real mama's girls.
It'll be hell.	Tell me about it.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!	Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!

She's a pro.	What?
Is there any syrup?	Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.	That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Van Cartier.	You know?  About me?  About everything?
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?	You re okay -- for a civilian.

What?	I... I brought you something.
I... I brought you something.	A cigarette?
A cigarette?	An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?	Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.

So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?	Three years.  Sister.
Three years.  Sister.	Three years.  A rookie.
Three years.  A rookie.	A novice.
A novice.	Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
You have to help me	Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.	No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!	She won't?  Why not?
She won't?  Why not?	She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.	She said that?  Reverend Mother?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.	What?
What?	Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.	Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?	We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.	Are you sure?
Mary Clarence!	Now you.
We need experience.	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Bobs	Experience!  Right?
Experience!  Right?	Right.
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.	Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.	Really?
Who are all these people?	This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.	Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.	Honey.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.	Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Mary Clarence!	Keep moving!
Goddamn it!	Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!	Experience!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?	I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.	We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...	Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
What?	Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.	I don't want to mess anyone up...
I don't want to mess anyone up...	Give me a C.  A C!

Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.	We're nuns!
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.	A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Are you leaving us?	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?	Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?	They're from my old convent.
Run!  Take off!	Again?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Mary Clarence!	Bless you.

Very well.	Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
St. Anne's?	Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.

Miss Van Cartier.	What? 
What? 	Your cigarette -- out.
It has come to pass.	What?
What?	I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.

You mean black people?	Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.	What's a concubine?
What's a concubine?	Check your driver's license.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?	Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?	Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change

How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"	Would you like that?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.	Can do.
No!  No!  I can't do this!	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.

As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.	Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...	No problem.
No problem.	The vow of obedience.
The vow of obedience.	Like to who?
And the vow of chastity.	I'm outta here.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.	A what?

I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.	What's wrong with my life?
What's wrong with my life?	From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Yeah?	Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?

I got it.	Come, Sister.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.	Mary Clarence!
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?	Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.

Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!	We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
Sometimes it's not enough!	You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?	It never solves anything.
It never solves anything.	Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."

Really catching on.	Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!	Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
So... hi there.	I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.	Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!	I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!

Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.	But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.	I am?
I am?	You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.	What?
What?	You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.

No.  No.	You're my Olympic event.

Please let me try.  I'm begging you.	And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?	I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.	A vote?
A vote?	Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
But... wait a minute...	The majority has spoken.
You sent for me?	You have a phone call.
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.	Really.  Well, that makes two of us.

But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!	A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.	Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.

Oh?	You saved my life.
You saved my life.	I'm a Christian.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.	Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?	You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.

They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!

Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.	Like what?
Like what?	Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.	You son-of-a-bitch!
I just need a few more weeks,	But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!	Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
What'd she say?	You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?	She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.	So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?	Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!	What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?	It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.	You're supposed to be hiding out!
You're supposed to be hiding out!	I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.	Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.	I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.	Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.	I am?
I am?	Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..	Really?  Lieutenant?
Really?  Lieutenant?	I've been worried about you.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?	No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.	Me too.
Me too.	You're not... seeing anybody?
You're not... seeing anybody?	No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.	I have?
I have?	You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
I've got to go.	Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?	I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Vince knows you're here.	How?
How?	Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
I can't go with you.	What?
What?	I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.	You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.	I think they'd understand.
I think they'd understand.	That's not the point!  They need me!
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?	You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.	Nuns?
What're you doing?	Even nuns have to pee.
Don't you have a concert to go to?	That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?	I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.	Yeah, like what?
Hey, girls.	Hail, Mary.
Hail, Mary.	Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.	Oh-huh.
Oh-huh.	People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.	Really.
Really.	But -- wait.
We could put you into our witness protection program.	A hiding place.
Then one day they find you.	They open a window.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.	Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?	Where's who?
Where's who?	You won't even tell us?
You won't even tell us?	I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We're looking for Mike.	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.	Who are you guys?
Who are you guys?	We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
But you didn't tell me!	We didn't tell you what?
We didn't tell you what?	That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
A nun?	I'm telling you!
Vince -- is she... okay?	Maybe. 
And if she runs?	Take care of it.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.	It's a bluff, Vince.
It's a bluff, Vince.	You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
It's done?	Not... totally.
Not... totally.	What's the problem?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?	It didn't happen.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.	Yeah...
Well?	It didn't work, Vince.
It didn't work, Vince.	You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Right.	So, take it off.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.	Maybe pants.
Get her!	Which one!
There she is!	Which one?
I can't see anything in here!	Willy -- hit the lights.
Joey?	Where is she?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.	She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?	Yeah, right -- when I see it.
She's gettin' away!	Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.	No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
You didn't shoot!	Neither did you!
Neither did you!	I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.	That's what I figured, too.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?	For like, twelve zillion eternities?
A sweater.	And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
What's she doing?	She's praying.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?	Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
It should be here any minute.	Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.	We're losing it.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.	That should have tipped us.
We've got to save her!	We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes, Mary Patrick?	Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Sister Mary Patrick?	Yes?
Yes?	I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.	Really...
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.	But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.	All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Peace on Earth.	However, we can also pray for other things.
However, we can also pray for other things.	Measles.
Is this like your old convent?	Which convent was that, Sister?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.	Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!	That was exciting!
He's not like other guys.	He's decent.
He's decent.	He's kind.
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.
It's better than ice cream.	It's better than springtime.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.	It's brought people back to the church.
Ice cream!	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.	Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!	It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?	We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
An... entertainer?	She wasn't a nun?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!	She's our inspiration!
It's so beautiful...	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!	But how do we get there?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?	A Benedictine.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!	Christy.
Not a note.	Impossible.
I don't understand.  Where is she?	Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?	She said they were from her old convent.
She said they were from her old convent.	But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.	But where?
Reverend Mother?	Yes?
Yes?	Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.	We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.	We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.	Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.	But, Bishop...
But, Bishop...	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.	I lied.
I lied.	I know. 
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.	And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.	She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.	Can you hold?  Can you try?
She's a nun, Vince.	I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.	She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
She's... she's a nun.	Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
We both missed.	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Where?	Find 'em!
If we could speak alone.	This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?	Many have.
Many have.	Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Who took the meat?	Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.	These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?	Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?	Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.	How did you hear this?
How did you hear this?	He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
Certainly not.	Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.	Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
What the hell are you doing?	You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?	Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
They spend two days in chains.	Two days... ?  For murder?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.	I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.	You must have missed your mark.
You must have missed your mark.	I hit him square.
I hit him square.	I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?	I was afraid of this.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?	To place it inside its coffin.
No bleeding.	What is that?
What is that?	This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
We must be a curious sight to him.	What are you spying on?
What are you spying on?	The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
He is a behemoth.	A diseased monster.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.	I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.	In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.	... Brom Bones...
... Brom Bones...	He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.	Bring Young Masbath here.
Bring Young Masbath here.	You need to sleep.
You need to sleep.	Bring him.
Bring him.	You need rest.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.	You will stay at her side?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.	Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Stains of blood.	What of it?
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.	What?
What?	When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?	All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...	The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
It is sacrilege!	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
I will not allow it.  I will not!	Protest to my superiors if you like.
Protest to my superiors if you like.	Your superiors are two days away!
Your superiors are two days away!	Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?	Does that look like an animal hanging?
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.	No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.	Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.

Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!	He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.	You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!	Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.	Pardon me?
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?	When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Do you have these persons' wills?	I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.	Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?	Hmm?  See them?
Hmm?  See them?	May we look at them now?
May we look at them now?	Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Maybe you should take this.	A fine idea.
Damn... damn... damn...	Master Hardenbrook...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?	Well... that might be... helpful.
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.	He drowned.  Anyone could see.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.	There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.	I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.	Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.	Have they nothing to fear presently?
Have they nothing to fear presently?	Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.	And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.	But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Very few, if any.	Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?

There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.	Chosen me?
Chosen me?	These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.	Not for lack of trying.
Not for lack of trying.	Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?	I shall, gladly.
I shall, gladly.	Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.	More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.	No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?	Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
The Widow Windsor.	Is that all you say?  Look at her.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.	It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.	The militia?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...	And now Jonathan Masbath.
And now Jonathan Masbath.	Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?	He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?	Believe?
What is that you wear?	My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.	Well... so much for common sense.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.	Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.	I know it.
Listen to what you say....	No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...	At times I do.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.	Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.

Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.	I did not ask you to, did I?
What is the common thread between these victims?	I'm sure I don't know.
I'm sure I don't know.	We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.	How could he?
How could he?	His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Where are we going?	Up.
What is it?	It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Out there.  What do you see?	The Western Woods.
The Western Woods.	Look again.
Are you familiar with magnets?	What kind of nuts?
What kind of nuts?	Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
It's spectacular.	Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.	No, I couldn't...
No, I couldn't...	I have others.  All I need is this.
Thank you.	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.	Father said witches live there.
Father said witches live there.	Witches do not exist.  However...
What is it?	Listen.
Listen.	I hear nothing.
I hear nothing.	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
We are leaving.	What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.	How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
We should not go much further in this murk.	Should we go back?
Should we go back?	We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?	"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.	You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.	Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.	True enough.
True enough.	Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?	Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
What is it?	Stay back.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?	We should go.
We should go.	Why this tree?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.	Man or woman?
Man or woman?	All I saw was their lantern.
All I saw was their lantern.	Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?	Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What good is this?	To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.	And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.	Yes.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.	But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?	No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.	In test... what?
In test... what?	Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.	What does it mean?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?	Baltus Van Tassel.
Baltus Van Tassel.	Did your father take a loan?
Did your father take a loan?	Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.	There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I was getting worried.  Who was it?	Lady Van Tassel.
Lady Van Tassel.	What was she doing?
What was she doing?	Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?	No.  They are all missing.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.	What books?
What books?	Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.	But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
What now?  Where is she?	Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 	I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?	Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Why... why are you like this?	You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
This is farewell.	Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.	I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Climb up!	Lady Van Tassel...
Lady Van Tassel...	I know.  Hold on.
What can we do?	Take the reins.
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
How are you?	Tired.
Forgive me, I didn't know.	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.	Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?	You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.	Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.	Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...	Other people?
Other people?	Small talk.
Small talk.	It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?	Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.	My suitor?
My suitor?	The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.	He has proposed to me twice.
He has proposed to me twice.	Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.	Are you so superstitious?
Are you so superstitious?	To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.	There is no such thing as magic.
There is no such thing as magic.	Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?	Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.	You are funny.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?	May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?	You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.	I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
These scars.  How did you get them?	I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.	It would be interesting to find out.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.	Yes, he does.  May I try?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...	You made this, and the drawings?
You made this, and the drawings?	Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.	Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?	If you want.  But...
If you want.  But...	Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Thank you.  No.  Here...	I insist that you have it.
I insist that you have it.	Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.	That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
You promised justice.	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?	People have put their trust in you.
People have put their trust in you.	They have done nothing of the sort.
They have done nothing of the sort.	Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
Why would you do such a thing?	No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...	I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.	You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.	What are you on about?

The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.	Must I hear this?

Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?	To avenge his father, and the others.
To avenge his father, and the others.	But, why?  Tell me why.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.	What troubles you?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.	What has happened?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.	What?
What?	She is not your birth mother, is she?
She is not your birth mother, is she?	No, but... why do you ask that?
No, but... why do you ask that?	What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?	She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?	Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.	If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?	I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
It is only me.	Katrina.  Why do you follow?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?	I apologize if I worried you.
I apologize if I worried you.	A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.	But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
Blood.	What did you say?
What are you doing?	Just... keep where you are.
My God... what has happened?	He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?	The skull is gone.
The skull is gone.	Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
What... what are you doing... ?	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What is so urgent?	Come with me.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.	It was you there?
It was you there?	When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.

The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.	Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.	What would you have me believe?
What would you have me believe?	If you think I am behind this, say it.
If you think I am behind this, say it.	The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.	Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Katrina...	Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.
The church.	He moves too fast.
What was that?	His horse.
Ichabod...	Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Quickly, close it.	No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.	I... I can't do this.
I... I can't do this.	We have no choice.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?	It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Returning to the Western Woods?	Yes, actually.
Yes, actually.	Use caution.
Use caution.	Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.	As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.	No.  She has gone out.
No.  She has gone out.	Where?
Where?	She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?	Very little.  I must be going...
It appears well.  It has already clotted.	Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?	It is fine.  Now, I must...
I know you saw me.	What... ?
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!
Let her go!	Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?	I can show exactly.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...	To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!	What did you say?
What did you say?	Turn around.  Now!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?	Yes.  Here...
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?	You are from the Hollow?
You are from the Hollow?	In a way, yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.	Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.	The Horseman.  Yes.
The Horseman.  Yes.	Sit.
Can you help?	You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
What... what are you doing?	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.	Doctor, he is awake.
You... you are alive.	Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
He rides tonight.	Father saw you die.
Father saw you die.	He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.	No one will believe your lies, whore.
No one will believe your lies, whore.	This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
Go home.	May I see my mother?
May I see my mother?	You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.	She did not do it... please listen...
She did not do it... please listen...	She is guilty.
She is guilty.	No, sir, please... she is innocent...
No, sir, please... she is innocent...	She has confessed.
She has confessed.	No.
No.	She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.	Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.	Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?	I can't remember.
I can't remember.	There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.

Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.	Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.	Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
Thank ye.	Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.	I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.	We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.	I like them french-fried potaters.
I like them french-fried potaters.	Yeah, me too.
I don't reckon.	If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
Yeah, they's good all right.	You got any money?
You got any money?	They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.	Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.

All right then.	I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.	That boy wants me to.
That boy wants me to.	All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?	I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.	You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.	See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Thank ye.	Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.	Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?	Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?	No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.	I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.	He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.	Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.	He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?	Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.	Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.	Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.	Good to know you, Karl.
How 'bout you, Jerry.	How are you, Bill?
How are you, Bill?	Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?	Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.	Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.

Is him stayin' here workin' out?	He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.

... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.	They was a boy. We made friends.

I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?	He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.	He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.	You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.

Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.	Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.	See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.	I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.	Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.	He does make some funny noises.
You know what, by God?	What?
What?	You know what we ought to do tonight?
You know what we ought to do tonight?	Please Doyle, don't.
Please Doyle, don't.	Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.	Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.	You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.	No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.	Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 	Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.	But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.	This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.	You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.	You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.	That might be better than this.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.	What do you want, hun?
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.	What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
How'd your baptizin' go?	It went real good.
It went real good.	Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?	Would y'all like that?
All right, y'all gonna go with me?	Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.	I'll be back in a little bit then.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.	He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.	Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?	No sir.
No sir.	No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
I ain't sure.	You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
I want to watch T.V.	Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.	Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Stop it, Doyle!	You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!	Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.	I get nervous, that's all I know.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.	That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.	I hate you!
I hate you!	Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?	Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure, I guess.	Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.	I know Albert. We're friends.
I know Albert. We're friends.	I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.	That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
You like that Vaughan?	Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.	You enjoying yourself, Karl?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.	Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.	Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?	Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.	Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
You got that shit right.	What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.	If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!	It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.	I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.	That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.	I thought I told you to keep out!
What's in your bag?	This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.	What's all them books?
What's all them books?	Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.	You believe in the Bible?
You believe in the Bible?	A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.	Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.	You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?	Childers.
Childers.	Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
I want to be baptized.	Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
Don't hit that boy no more.	You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.	How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?	Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.	What numbers do you punch?
What numbers do you punch?	I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.	I aim to kill you with it.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.	I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.	They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.	Why? Hi, Karl.
Why? Hi, Karl.	He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...	Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.	Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.	But maybe just for awhile --
But maybe just for awhile --	I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
What's you last name?	Childers.
Childers.	What are all them books?
What are all them books?	Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.	How come you're carryin' them around with you.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.	Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.	Don't you live somewhere?
Don't you live somewhere?	I did live there in the state hospital.
I did live there in the state hospital.	Why'd you live there?
Why'd you live there?	I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.	They let you out?
They let you out?	Yeah.
Yeah.	How come?
How come?	They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.	Are you well?
Are you well?	I reckon I feel all right.
I reckon I feel all right.	You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Do you like to play football?	I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.	Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?	Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.	Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?	You told me to come by.
You told me to come by.	Did you want to play ball with us?
Did you want to play ball with us?	I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.	Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.	All right then.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.	I don't want to worry your mama with company.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.	Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.	I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?	They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?	Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.	They still around, your folks?
They still around, your folks?	My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.	How do you know?
How do you know?	He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.	How did your mama die?
How did your mama die?	You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.	I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.

How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?	She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.	Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.	It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.	Why did he do that, reckon.
Why did he do that, reckon.	'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?	Yeah, I did.

Two people.	Were they bad people?

Maybe they needed it.	I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.	It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?

I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?	They ort to. You're a good boy.

Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.	Naw.
Naw.	And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.	That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?

Yes sir. You ort not know that language.	I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?

You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.	I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.

He ain't no count.	You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.	I don't reckon I know.
I don't reckon I know.	And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?	Naw.
Naw.	'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?

I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.	Why not? It died?
Why not? It died?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Why?
Why?	Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.

So it died when it come out?	My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.

Yes sir. Right then it was.	A boy or girl?
A boy or girl?	A little ol' boy.
A little ol' boy.	You threw it in a trash barrel?
You threw it in a trash barrel?	I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.

It was still alive when you buried it?	I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.	That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.	I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.

That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.	Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.

Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.	I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.	We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.	Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.	You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.

Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?	I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?	Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good.

You don't want to give away all your books.	I aim fer you to have 'em.

Reckon what kind of a feelin'?	Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?	Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?	You know I would. Whatever you want.
You know I would. Whatever you want.	Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend.

Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.	Okay.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.	Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.	Nice to meet you, Karl.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.	Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?	Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?	I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.	I'm glad of it, honey.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.	They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.	He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.

You all right, Mama?	I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.	We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?	No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.	Did Vaughan go home?
Did Vaughan go home?	Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.	Did Karl go to bed?
Did Karl go to bed?	I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.	I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.	I know he does.
I know he does.	Mama?
Mama?	Huh?
Huh?	Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.	Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.	Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?	I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.

Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.	He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.	I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.	We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.	Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.	I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
You walk fast, don't you?	I reckon.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?	I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.	Me, too.
I'm ye boy.	I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got no boy.	I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.	I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got no boy.	They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.	I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.	Yes, I guess you are.
Yes, I guess you are.	I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.	You better go get your things.
You better go get your things.	I ain't got nothing but them books.
I ain't got nothing but them books.	You better go get 'em.
You better go get 'em.	All right then.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?	I want to come back and stay here.
I want to come back and stay here.	Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.	I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.	Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?	Naw.
Naw.	Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?	Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.	Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?	I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.	I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?	I reckon.
I reckon.	I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.	I never was no good with history.
I never was no good with history.	No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.	I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.	He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Karl, you up?	Yes sir.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	Do they know about you?
Do they know about you?	My history.
My history.	Yeah.
Yeah.	I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.	I'll be.
I'll be.	That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.	I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?	Tolerable, I reckon.
Tolerable, I reckon.	Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
You scared me.	I didn't aim to.
I didn't aim to.	Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?	No ma'am.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.	I'll be dog.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?	Right now?
Right now?	Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.	Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?	Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am.	Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.	Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.	Okay.
Thank ye.	It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?	I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.	Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.	I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.	That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?	I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?	Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.	I believe you. I really do.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.	All right then.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?	I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?	No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.	Well, okay. I got you some.
Well, okay. I got you some.	Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.	Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?	He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.	All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.	Ma'am?
Ma'am?	Yeah.
Yeah.	You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.	Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.	You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.	We sure like havin' you.
We sure like havin' you.	Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.	Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.	It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?	I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.	What brings you back?
What brings you back?	What's that you say?
What's that you say?	Why are you here now?
Why are you here now?	They turned me loose from the state hospital.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.	Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?	I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.	Do you have family here?
Do you have family here?	Not really to speak of.
Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?
So, you're really going to stay here?	That boy wants me to.
That boy wants me to.	Did you knock on the door yet?
Did you knock on the door yet?	Naw, I ain't.
Naw, I ain't.	How long have you been standing here?
How long have you been standing here?	Quite a spell, I reckon.
Quite a spell, I reckon.	Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?	I done et just a little bit ago.
I done et just a little bit ago.	I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.	I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.	Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?	I reckon not.
I reckon not.	Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.	Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.	Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?	I've heard it said that way.
I've heard it said that way.	Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?

You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?	I wouldn't never hurt them.
I wouldn't never hurt them.	That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.	Oh. How about before that?
Oh. How about before that?	Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.	I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.	I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.	Okay.
Okay.	This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.	What's wrong? Is everything okay?
What's wrong? Is everything okay?	That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?	Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?	Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?	I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?	Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.	I know.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?	Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.	He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.	He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.	What about me?
What about me?	I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.	Karl is a guy guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.	Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.	Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.	I'm sorry.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.	That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.	In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?	Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.	Do you smell shit?
Do you smell shit?	Yeah.
Let's just go, Marsha.	No, we have to get this story.
No, we have to get this story.	I thought you'd be happy to leave.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.	Why won't he talk to women?
My name's Jerry Woolridge.	Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.	Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?	Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.	Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?	No thank you.
No thank you.	The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.	Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.	Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?	I knew he slept in a toolshed.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.	His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--	Before they were married?
Before they were married?	I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.	That's really strange. What does it mean?
That's really strange. What does it mean?	One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.	How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?	It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.	Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.	He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.	Signs?
Signs?	Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Is he leaving right this minute?	We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.	I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.	I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.	Where will he go?
Where will he go?	Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.	Will he be supervised?
Will he be supervised?	As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.	Why?
Why?	Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.	You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?	Yes.
Yes.	I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.	Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
What!	Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?	No! At least I don't think I am!
No! At least I don't think I am!	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?	An invitation?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?	It's my birthday.
It's my birthday.	And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?	I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.

Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--	Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.	And what are you, his chaperone?
And what are you, his chaperone?	Actually, I'm his father.
Like me, too.	I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.	No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge. 
Better make it charge. 	I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?	I confess.
I confess.	I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?	Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.	And your father? Is he from New York?
And your father? Is he from New York?	Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.	Just like me.
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?	It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.	Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?	American literature. What else?
American literature. What else?	What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?	Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.	Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?	Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?	Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.	That's the subject of my last chapter.
That's the subject of my last chapter.	Not an easy book.
Not an easy book.	Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Jesus, what happened to you?	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.	What happened?
What happened?	I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.	It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.	Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?	Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.	I'd love to.
I'd love to.	Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.	I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?	Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?	Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.	Forty-one pages.
What'll it be, Auggie?	Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
And what about for you?	Huh?
Huh?	What about for you?
What about for you?	For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 	Do me a favor, will you?
Do me a favor, will you?	What's that, Sol?
What's that, Sol?	Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."	What's the difference?
What's the difference?	It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.	Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."	Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?	Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?	Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.	The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?	Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.	The Queen of England?
The Queen of England?	Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.	I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Are you closed?	You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?	Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?	No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.	Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I did.	It's yours?
It's yours?	It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.	I didn't know you took pictures.
I didn't know you took pictures.	I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.

Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.	A photographer ...
A photographer ...	Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.

I'd like to see your pictures some day.	It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
They're all the same.	That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.

It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.	Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?	I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all.

It's kind of overwhelming.	You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.	But they're all the same.
But they're all the same.	They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.

Slow down, huh?
Slow down, huh?	Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.	It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Hey, man, good to see you.	This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?	It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.	How old, kid?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?	Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?	I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.	Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.	Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.

Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.	He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.	If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?	He's crazy.
He's crazy.	No, he's not. You are.
No, he's not. You are.	You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.	It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.	Fuck you, kid.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.	Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?	No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.	Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.	For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?	Not a peep.
Not a peep.	I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.	That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.	Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
So what did he say when he called?	Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?	It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.	We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hey, man, how's it going?	Hi, Auggie.
Two, right?	Uh, better make it one.
Uh, better make it one.	You usually get two.
You usually get two.	Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.	Ah-hah.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.	That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.	Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?	Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.	Anything good?
Anything good?	Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.	It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.	Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?	You got it.
So. Are we ready?	Ready. Any time you are.
Ready. Any time you are.	I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.	Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?	Every word.
Every word.	Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Did you ever go back to see her?	Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.	She probably died.
She probably died.	Yeah, probably.
Yeah, probably.	Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.	I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.	It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.	I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.	You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.	Anything for art, eh, Paul?
Anything for art, eh, Paul?	I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.	And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?	Yes, I suppose I do.
What do you mean?	I mean, it's a good story.
I mean, it's a good story.	Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?	Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.	Eighteen and a half years.
Eighteen and a half years.	Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.	You're looking good, Auggie.
You're looking good, Auggie.	No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?	I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.	And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?	You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.	At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.	I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.	Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.	This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.	You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?	Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.	Like what?
Like what?	Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.	Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?	Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.	Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.	Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.

Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?	It means "happiness."
It means "happiness."	I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.	I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.	You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?	Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?	That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.

You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?	Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.	It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.	You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.	It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.	A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.	And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.	You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.	Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.	Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?	Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.	Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.	I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.	Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.	You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?	I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.	You don't give up, do you?
You don't give up, do you?	Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.	Where to?
Where to?	Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
I told her she was going to meet her father.	You what?
You what?	It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.	I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.	Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.	Yeah, like what?
Yeah, like what?	That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.	Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.	Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.	And what's that supposed to mean?
And what's that supposed to mean?	She looks just like you.
She looks just like you.	Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.	When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.	You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
So you're just going to give up and go home?	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.	Still, you can't just write her off.
Still, you can't just write her off.	Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.

Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.	Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.	I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.	No you're not.

Five thousand bucks.	And you're giving it to me?
And you're giving it to me?	It's all yours, baby.
It's all yours, baby.	For keeps?
For keeps?	For keeps.
For keeps.	I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.	I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
There's just one thing I want to know.	Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.	No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.	How long you been working for me, Auggie?
How long you been working for me, Auggie?	I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.	It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?	I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.

Lovely.	She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.

A little. Not much.	This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
It's for you.	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?

When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!	Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?	Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.	Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
Does it hurt?	Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?	I thought maybe he was pretending.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on.

And how much are these?	Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.

His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.	You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?	Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.

And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?	Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.

There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains.

I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?	I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?	Just passing through.
Just passing through.	Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.

I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.	It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.	It'll cost you five bucks.
It'll cost you five bucks.	Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?	Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.

Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?	Not a one.
Not a one.	Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.

It was just a thought.	Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.	What's your offer?
What's your offer?	Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.

The name is Cyrus Cole.	Paul. Paul Benjamin.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.	An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."

And have you mended them?	I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.

You named the kid after yourself, huh?	That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.	And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.	Hi there, little brother.
Hi there, little brother.	Say hi to Paul.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.	Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?	Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.	That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.

Well?	Well what?
Well what?	Aren't you going to say anything?
Aren't you going to say anything?	What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?	I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.	I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.	Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.	Baby? And what baby is that?
Baby? And what baby is that?	Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.	Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.	Yeah? And why is that?
Yeah? And why is that?	Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.	Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.	They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.	I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.	I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?	Huh?
Huh?	You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?	Tick-tock, tick-tock.

No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.	No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.	I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.	I owe you something.
I owe you something.	It's okay, mister. No big deal.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.	Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.	Well, if you put it that way...

You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.	That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.	Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.	I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.

Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.	That's okay. I've already had lunch.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.	You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.	I mean breakfast.

Well, maybe just one. To be polite.	Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Mostly what.	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.	You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.	That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?	Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.

That's where the what comes in.	The what?

I can take care of myself. Don't worry.	Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
I didn't expect to see you again.	Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
That's it. Just the two rooms.	This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.	I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.

I don't have much time. 	Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind.

I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?	Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.

I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.	So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.	Why don't you go to the police?
Why don't you go to the police?	You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?	If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.	The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.

What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.	It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.	It looks like they've met in this apartment.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.	That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.	Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.	Let's not get too idealistic.
Let's not get too idealistic.	Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.	One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.	Thanks. 
Thanks. 	What time did you get to bed last night?
What time did you get to bed last night?	I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.	You work too hard, you know that?
You work too hard, you know that?	Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.	Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.	If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.	That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?	If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.	Come on, just a little hint.
Come on, just a little hint.	Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.	The inspiration.
The inspiration.	Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?	No way.
No way.	All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.	The end.
The end.	No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Celebrate? What for?	It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.	Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?	I just did.
I just did.	I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.	Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.	Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?	Absolutely. We would be honored.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.	His only copy?
His only copy?	His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.	Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?	You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
I don't know.	Is it yours?
Is it yours?	Yeah, it might be.
Yeah, it might be.	Here, catch.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.	Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.	Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.	Yeah, I picked it up.
Yeah, I picked it up.	And started to run.
And started to run.	And started to run.
And started to run.	Good thinking.
Good thinking.	That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.	You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?	Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.	So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.	That's it. In a nutshell.
That's it. In a nutshell.	Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.	No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.	A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.	That money is my whole future.
That money is my whole future.	Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?	It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.	Well?
Well?	It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault.	If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.	The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?	I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.	No wonder he was angry.
No wonder he was angry.	He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.	What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.	I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.	I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.	You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.	I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.	Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.	Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hi, kid.	Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.	Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.	It's all right. I really do know them.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?	I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.	Now ask him who his mother was.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.	Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Hot coffee or iced coffee?	Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?	Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?	If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 	I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
How do you want that cooked?	Medium rare, please.
Medium rare, please.	Fries?
Fries?	Yes, please.
Yes, please.	Lettuce and tomato?
Lettuce and tomato?	Yes, please.
Yes, please.	You want another one of these, too?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...	Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.	What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...	...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.	Oh, yeh?
Oh, yeh?	Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.	Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.	Carl Heine's type.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.	No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.	And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.	That's obvious.
That's obvious.	You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?	No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?	None.
None.	Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...	I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
I don't know.	You don't.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...	I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.	...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.	So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.	They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?	Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...	Why?  If they could never take title.
Why?  If they could never take title.	Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.	In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.	Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?	Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.	When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?	That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.	Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?	Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.	Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?	A thousand.
A thousand.	So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.	Is that your third question?
Is that your third question?	It is.
It is.	You done your math right.
Now, Mister Gi...	Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?	It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.	I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?	Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...	No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.	Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?	Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.	All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?	Well, what if?
Well, what if?	Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.	Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.	You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?	Happy for him.  And relieved.
Happy for him.  And relieved.	So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.	Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?	Closer to eight.
Closer to eight.	So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?	Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.	And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.	Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.	Why not?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.	But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.	So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.	We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.	Well, it seems to me...
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.	It seems human.  To me.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.	You're implying th...
You're implying th...	I said.  No further questions.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.	At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.	Easy.  Slow is best.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.	Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.	We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
My mom.  Would be the problem.	Why?  We're only talking.
I can just feel my spirits soar.	Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...	I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...	It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...	Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...	I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.	I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...	The Japs did it.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...	There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.	Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Did you write that column?	I did.  But the jury won't s...
I did.  But the jury won't s...	It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
You don't believe in God anymore.	Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.	You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.	Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.	Those aren't the facts that matter.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...	...but he found you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.	And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.	It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.	So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?	More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
Well, what then, sergeant?	What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?	Oh, in a heartbeat.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.	Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.	These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.	And the next one...?
And the next one...?	From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.	And the last...?
And the last...?	Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?	You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.	And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?	Pretty darn clear.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.	He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Did you say more?	I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.	And why.  Is that?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.	Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?	Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?	Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.	My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.	All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...	Objection!
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.	Tht was summation, Your H...
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.	Objection!  Speculation.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.	I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...	Twelve.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?	My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.	But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.	Oh, yes.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.	Like you couldn't believe.
Greedy.	He didn't want to lose any more.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...	That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.	That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.	<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?	No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Robbed.  He was angry.	Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?	Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.	And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?	Carl Heine came.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.	He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.	Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...	But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Yes.  Initially.	Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.	Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?	I have told the truth.
I have told the truth.	You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.	I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.	Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.	Yes.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?	I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.	Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.	Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
How long you have this detail?	Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
You mean, early morning the 16th?	No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.	Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
I did.  Boy.	Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.	Won't take two.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.	It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?	Have a look.  At nothing.
You gonna climb that with one arm?	You're right.  I better use two.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...	Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.	No, you don't.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?	You're wondering why I held it.
You're wondering why I held it.	I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.	Yes, he was.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.	To my father.  Everything counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.	Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.	That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.	Well, why does it?
Well, why does it?	Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
That's when he fell.	Fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...	Still lashed to the mast.
Still lashed to the mast.	He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.	Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?	Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...	Maybe...?
Maybe...?	Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.	But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.	Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?	The knife.  What knife?
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.	The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...	He hit his head.  On the way in.
You think so?	The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.	Well, anything coulda caused that.
Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.	You ever been strangled by a single hand?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?	Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
We don't let go, you s...	It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
What for, Sheriff?	We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
You always run with the well open?	I was checking the cables.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.	Naw, I had that around for a while.
Naw, I had that around for a while.	Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.	Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...	Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
What makes you think I play?	Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
White or black?	You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
You must think I like losing.	I think you like learning.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.	Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You wouldn't even see it move.	You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...	Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.	I should show them an American?
And what's that?	That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.	You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
You want me to say that.	I want you.  To tell the truth.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.	I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.	And what do you believe?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.	Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.	Maybe.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...	Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.	And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?	Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.	Does it now?
Does it now?	A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.	You have to wonder.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?	It is.
It is.	Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.	He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.	But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?	It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?	Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.	No spare.
No spare.	No.
No.	So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?	Apparently.
Apparently.	I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
I believe so.	Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.	He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.	You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?	Possible.  But not darn likely.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?	She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.	And her farmhouse...?
And her farmhouse...?	The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.	Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.	What else could it be?
What else could it be?	Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.	<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?	As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.	Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.	Well...
Well...	Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?	Obviously.
Obviously.	Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.	The same.
The same.	So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...	If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.	Is it possible?
Is it possible?	Sure, anything's poss...
Sure, anything's poss...	Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.	I already said that, b...
I already said that, b...	<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
For certain, no.	But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.	For the third time, yes.
Can I say something, here?	Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?	Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
Are you absol...	<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...	I wouldn't say encouraged.
I wouldn't say encouraged.	Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.	Not in those words.
Not in those words.	So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.	Carl never lied.
Carl never lied.	Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?	He had no reason to.
He had no reason to.	Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?	I can't speak for him.
I can't speak for him.	You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...	Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...	That's all he said.
Improved...how?	As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.	Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."	I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...	Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?	That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.	The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...	Such as?
Such as?	Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?	Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?	Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
Are these your bags?	Yes.  And that one, too.
Yes.  And that one, too.	Okay, doll.

Which of you dolls is Daphne?	Bull fiddle.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.	Beat it, Buster.
Beat it, Buster.	Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.	Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?	Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Yes, Sue?  What is it?	I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.	All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
I beg your pardon.	All right, girls - from the top again.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.	Funny?  In what way?
Funny?  In what way?	I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.	Thank you ever so.
Thank you ever so.	You're welcome.
You're welcome.	It's entirely mutual.
Upsy-daisy.	Fresh!
No --- how does it go?	Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?	
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?	A what?
A what?	My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.

He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.	Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.

I'll say.	I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?	Yeah.  Why?

We'll take a rain check.	I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.

I may spill something.	So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.	What's the surprise?
What's the surprise?	Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.	When?
When?	We better have a drink first.
We better have a drink first.	Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.	No fair guessing.
Who needs vermouth?	We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
And bring the cocktail shaker.	Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Not you, Sugar.	I'm just going to get some ice.
I'll carry the instruments.	Thank you, Daphne.
Here you are, Sugar.	A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?	You betcha.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?	We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
What do you think you're doing?	Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.	You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.	I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -	That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.	But there's one thing I envy you for.
But there's one thing I envy you for.	What's that?
What's that?	You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.	Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.	Okay.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.	Vanity Fair?
His yacht?	It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.	I'm a what?
I'm a what?	Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.	Come on, Daphne.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?	Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.	Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.	If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.	Yeah - Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.	Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -	Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
Josephine -	I guess she's not in here.
I guess she's not in here.	That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.	Well, I'll come back later.
Well, I'll come back later.	No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.	Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.	Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.	Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Do you suppose she went out shopping?	That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.	I met one of them.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.	I hope so.
I hope so.	What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
No!	Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.	No!
No!	Yes.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.	I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Did he get fresh?	Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.	What for?
What for?	And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
How did you get that bracelet?	You like it?
You like it?	I always did.
I always did.	Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -	Thirty-four.
Thirty-four.	He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.	That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Brand new.	This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Where did you girls play before?	Oh - here and there - and around.
How did those holes get there?	Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?	Yes.  For a whole year.
Yes.  For a whole year.	I thought you said three years.
I was it.	What's the big idea?
What's the big idea?	I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
It's about the Florida job.	The Florida job?
What's wrong with us?	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
We could pass for that.	- you got to be blonde -
- you got to be blonde -	We could dye our hair.
We could dye our hair.	- and you got to be girls.
- and you got to be girls.	We could -
Yes, I'm holding on.	Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!	What's with him - he drinks?
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?	Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.
Help yourself.	I am Osgood Fielding the Third.

It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.	Personally, I'm Type O.

You don't say.	Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.	You invest in shows?
You invest in shows?	No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.

You're not sure?	Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me	I'm not surprised.
I'm not surprised.	So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.	Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?	Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.	Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?	Bull fiddle.
Bull fiddle.	Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?	Most of the time I slap it.
Most of the time I slap it.	You must be quite a girl.
You must be quite a girl.	Wanna bet?
Wanna bet?	My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.	Why?
Why?	She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.	Goodbye?
Goodbye?	This is where I get off.
This is where I get off.	Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Please.  It won't happen again.	No, thank you.  I'll walk.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -	I'll throw up!
I'll throw up!	Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.	Who?
Who?	About that roadhouse -
About that roadhouse -	They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?

Daphne...	Yes, Osgood?
Yes, Osgood?	You're leading again.
You're leading again.	Sorry.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.	Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.	Come one!
Another bridesmaid?	Flower girl.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.	Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.	We can have it altered.
We can have it altered.	Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.	Why not?
Why not?	Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.	It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.	And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.	I don't care.

We'll adopt some.	But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!	Well - nobody's perfect.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?	Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.	Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.	Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?	Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -

Don't I know you two from somewhere?	We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.	Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?	To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.	You ain't going nowhere.
I don't like no witnesses.	We won't breathe a word.
We won't breathe a word.	You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?	Oh, no!
Anything today?	Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -	Thank you.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.	What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Oh?	Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.	You're making it up pretty good so far.
You're making it up pretty good so far.	The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
What's the job?	It's three weeks in Florida -
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?	Why?
Why?	Because I got some plans -
Because I got some plans -	I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -	And you'll be in all evening?
And you'll be in all evening?	Yes, Joe.
Yes, Joe.	Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.	My car?  Why, you -
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?	Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.	You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?	The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?	It's not the backs that worry me.
It's not the backs that worry me.	What kind of band is this, anyway?
What kind of band is this, anyway?	You got to be under twenty-five -
No, we couldn't!	William Morris!
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.	We'll take it!
We'll take it!	You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Well, here we are.	You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?	Yes, we're the new girls.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?	No - funerals.
No - funerals.	Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
We got it second-hand.	All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
We got time off for good behavior.	There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Tell what?	If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.	Where did he conduct?
Where did he conduct?	On the Baltimore and Ohio.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.	Oh.
Oh.	I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
Running away?  From what?	Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
We understand.	All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Put it here.	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.	Better keep a lookout.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?	I'm not very bright, I guess.
I'm not very bright, I guess.	I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.	No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.	Then why did you take this job?
Then why did you take this job?	I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.	Afford it?
Afford it?	Have you ever been with a male band?

That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!	Rough?
Rough?	I'll say.
I'll say.	You can't trust those guys.
You can't trust those guys.	I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!	Bingo?
Bingo?	You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.	Really?
Really?	Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.

That so?	Every time!
Every time!	You know - I play tenor sax.

But you're a girl, thank goodness.	Yeah.
Yeah.	That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.	Yeah.
Yeah.	You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -	You don't say?
You don't say?	Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.	Men!

So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.	Brains aren't everything.
Brains aren't everything.	I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?	You are?
You are?	That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.	About what?
About what?	About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.	What's in Florida?

Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.	You're entitled.
You're entitled.	Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.	Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -	I want mine to wear glasses.
I want mine to wear glasses.	Glasses?
Glasses?	Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?	Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Well, now that you've mentioned it -	They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Happy days.	I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
What's happened?	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.	I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.	Why not?
Why not?	Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?	Want to switch berths with me?
Want to switch berths with me?	Would you mind terribly?
Would you mind terribly?	Not at all.
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.	I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.	Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.	Saxophone player?
Saxophone player?	What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.	Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.	What makes you so sure?
What makes you so sure?	Just my feminine intuition.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.	She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.	My fault.
My fault.	You're not hurt, are you?
You're not hurt, are you?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	I wish you'd make sure.
I wish you'd make sure.	Why?
Why?	Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.

Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.	I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?

How's the stock market?	Up, up, up.
Up, up, up.	I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.

Hey.	Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.	Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Wow. You look beautiful.	Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!	Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.	What for?
What for?	To make sure youre okay.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?	Actually, I do.
It was such a long time ago.	Still--
Still--	If Ed ever found out....
If Ed ever found out....	Or Kat....
Or Kat....	And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.	Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.	Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Say something. Please.	I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Does Kat know?	Jeffrey told her last night.
Jeffrey told her last night.	Last night?
Wheres Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.
Why, with you.	My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks its--
Huh?	Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.	Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.	Sir, yes, sir!
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.	Oh, dont be that way.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!	Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.	Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.	It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.	So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Whats going on with you two?	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.	Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.	Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.	Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.	Mom, please.
Mom, please.	Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.	She did?
She did?	So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?	Um, just about everyone.
Um, just about everyone.	You are taking the piss?
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.	Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?	Im a hooker.
I thought you said you were crap.	I had to say something to get you here.
I had to say something to get you here.	Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Ill just check into a hotel.	Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?	Yeah, kind of.
You heading to the train station?	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.	Yeah.
Whats his problem?	What?
What?	Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.	Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?	No, thats not it.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.	No.
No.	It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.	Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.	And Kat was fully clothed.
And Kat was fully clothed.	But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.	Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.	Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.	Lasik surgeon, actually.
I didnt deserve her back then.	And you do now?
Nothing.	Doesnt look like nothing.
Hey.	Oh, hello.
Ah, a philosopher.	Shrink, actually.
Shrink, actually.	Crikey.
Crikey.	What?
What?	Nothing, nothing.
Nothing, nothing.	No, tell me.
No, tell me.	You Yanks and your therapy. Its great.  Its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Hey, man.	Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Sorry, can you give us a moment?	No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.	Hello, Katmandu.
Seeing you again....	Yeah?
Hey, Kat.	Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
Hey, you!	Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.	Maybe not her least... Theres always--
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?	I have regrets.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.	Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.	Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.	Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.	Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.	Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
That was a long time ago.	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.	So, whats your point?
So, whats your point?	I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?	Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.	Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?	Not for a dog.
Not for a dog.	Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Is this supposed to be an apology?	Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Youre not even listening.	When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.	Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.	Brilliant.
Brilliant.	Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.	I slept with your sister.
Im sorry?	I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Hi. Hey.	Kat.
You think we look like were trying too hard.	Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
What color are my shoes?	You have feet?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.	Youre funny.
Youre funny.	Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
Mission accomplished.	Really?  Dont get too attached.
Mmm.	Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!	Both.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.	I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?	Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?	Love.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.	He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.	Of course he is. Im here with my new man.  I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?	I dont know.
I dont know.	What does your gut say?
What does your gut say?	Youre too good for him.
No, count it, anyway.	Why?
Why?	Im compulsive and weird?
Six thousand, right?	On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.	How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.	That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.	Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You quitting?	Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
Who are they?	Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
What?	Its cute.
Its cute.	What is?
What is?	You stand on your tiptoes.
You stand on your tiptoes.	I do?
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?
A weekend?	A wedding.
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.	I think thats disgusting.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.	Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.	This happened to you?
This happened to you?	Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
How did you know that was me?	I have a friend at the magazine.
I have a friend at the magazine.	Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.	If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Would you grab my shampoo?	Shampoo, got it!
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.	Oh, no.
Oh, no.	Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
You shit!	I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.	And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?	Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.	First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
Yes.	What?!
What?!	When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?	I guess so.
I guess so.	What do you think?
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?	My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?	This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Dont stop asking questions, okay?	Okay.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.	Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Subtle?	I disappear. Its not about me.
Its hard to explain.	Show me.
Come on.	Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
Are you sure?	We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Is this for last night?	Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?	Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!	Not dollars. Pounds.
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?	No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.	What?
What?	Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.	But nothing did.
But nothing did.	Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!	Oh, cut the crap!
Oh, cut the crap!	I just hate seeing you so stuck.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.	He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.	You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	Its my job.
You have had girlfriends?	Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.	So, whyd you say yes to me?
So, whyd you say yes to me?	There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.	Desperation?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?	Make out with you for free.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?	Spontaneously combust?
Yeah. You?	Yeah.
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?	I didnt say he was worth it.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?	He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.	So whats with the nickname?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.	Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!	Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?	Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.	Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.	Hi.
I should go.	What?! No, no. You cant--
What?! No, no. You cant--	I have to.  Im the best man.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.	Thank you.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.	You have more than one gynecologist?
You have more than one gynecologist?	Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
You didnt have to do that.	I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Whats he do anyway?	Therapist.
Like fifteen.	Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?
You knew?	Im so sorry.
Hey, Sal.	I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.	I get all the glamour jobs.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?	Give it back? Are you nuts?
Give it back? Are you nuts?	You pawned it.
You pawned it.	Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
You want I nut him in the boat?	Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.	You want me to let him in?
You want me to let him in?	Of course, dont be silly.
Dad!	Hi, kiddo.
Hi, kiddo.	Meet Nick.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.	Ahoy!
So whyd you let him go?	Its complicated, Dad.
Its complicated, Dad.	Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
Yeah.	Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?	Just drunk enough.
Not yet...	...but its getting there. 
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?	Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I always wondered what happened with us.	I havent thought about that in years.
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?	Hard.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.	Is there any other way to take it?
I am now, sir.	At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What is it you do again?	What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
What do you say to that?	I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--	--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?	Will do.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.	You don't live around here, do you?
You don't live around here, do you?	No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.	Is he here in Borderdale?
Is he here in Borderdale?	I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.	Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?	David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.	Let me see it...
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?	Sometime, but not like this.
Sometime, but not like this.	It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?	Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.	Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?	Uh huh...
Uh huh...	That does it...
That does it...	Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.	I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!	I try...
And you say all them people is dead now?	That's right--
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.	Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?
That's where we come from first?	That's where we came from first.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?	Colored.
Colored.	Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?	Sure--
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.	What's his name?
What's his name?	Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 	What he talk 'bout?
What he talk 'bout?	Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.	And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
What about Sounder?	He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?	I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Well, how did you like the class, David?	It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?	Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.	Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...	You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...	He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.	You could? How?
You could? How?	I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!	Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.	My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?	Yes mam...
Yes mam...	Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.	What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.	But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.	But where is my daddy!?
But where is my daddy!?	I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...	Nothin'...
Nothin'...	And so you did your job, right?
And so you did your job, right?	Yes, mam...
Yes, mam...	Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!	What do that mean?
What do that mean?	Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?	Yes, Miss Johnson...
Yes, Miss Johnson...	Go on...
Go on...	Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?	She was dirty and wet...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?	No, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...	Can you swim?
Can you swim?	Yes mam...

Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--	Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
But, Charlie --	NO! N-O, NO!
I see you found what you was lookin' for.	I did look, Charlie, but I--
I did look, Charlie, but I--	No buts, Rita!
No buts, Rita!	Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!	Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!

You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!	You would do that, wouldn't you?
You would do that, wouldn't you?	You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.	Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.	It's cold, Daddy!
It's cold, Daddy!	Here, put my jacket over you.
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.	It was too dark, Daddy.
It was too dark, Daddy.	Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir...	You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.	Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
David Lee...	Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...	You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.	I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.	You learnin' anything at that school?
You learnin' anything at that school?	Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?	Yes, sir...
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.	We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?	Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--	"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"	Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Well, looka here...	Hi, Daddy...
Hi, Daddy...	Hi to you, son...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.	They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
We didn't find Sounder yet.	He'll show up one day.
He'll show up one day.	Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?	Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?	I think so...
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?	I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.	Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?	Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?	Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Son, that was some trip you went on...	Where was you, Daddy?
Where was you, Daddy?	That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?

Where did the sun go to, Daddy?	Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.	What happened afta that?
What happened afta that?	The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!	We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?	You bet we is!
You bet we is!	I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight, Daddy...	Goodnight to you, son...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...	Come here, son...
Mornin', son...	Mornin', Daddy...
Where's everybody?	They gone to the field...
They gone to the field...	Guess I can't just lay here, then.
You feel alright today, Daddy?	Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?	Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.	Thank you, Daddy...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.	You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?	No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
You hurt, Daddy!?	No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
From Miss Johnson --	Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...	September 4 -- how far away is that?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.	And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!	But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!	Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!	I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!	Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?	Yes, Daddy! Yes!
You know somethin', Daddy?	What's that, son?
What's that, son?	I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
What's your daddy's name?	Nathan Lee Morgan...
Mister, can you visit anybody here?	Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.	When's that?
When's that?	Sunday...
Sunday...	Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?	Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.	My father taught me...
Miss Boatwright --	Yes, David...
Yes, David...	Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.	David!
David!	Yes, ma'am...?
What's in there, David!?	Sausage and hambones!
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.	Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?	He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.	I don't look like no possum!
I don't look like no possum!	Act like one!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.	Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!	Thank you, Josie Mae.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!	Goodnight.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!	That's right!
That's right!	Where did it come from, Mama?
Where did it come from, Mama?	Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Ready to go, Mama!	Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
You got two shirts on?	Yes mam...
Yes mam...	When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Who's winning, Mama?	Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?	Same as we -- they pray.
Who is they?	Children, come here...
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!	David, come back here!
'Bye, Mama...	'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Did you see Daddy?	No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.	Can I go when the holiday comes?
Can I go when the holiday comes?	You sure can, son...
Any sign of Sounder?	No mam -- I looked all over.
No mam -- I looked all over.	I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
What is it, David Lee?	Listen, Mama...
Poor creature...	He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!	Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Can't sleep?	No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.	So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.	I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.

Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.	But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!	Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.	No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Can I go day after tomorrow?	Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.	Good night, Mama...
Good night, Mama...	Good night...
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.	I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?	Yes, mam...
Yes, mam...	Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.	Did you find your father?
Did you find your father?	Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.	I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
What's that you carryin'?	Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.	Who's Miss Johnson?
Who's Miss Johnson?	Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
So when I left, she gave me these books.	Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.	She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.	How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.	She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.	But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
What's wrong with him, David?	It's the heat.
It's the heat.	It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.	He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
What's wrong, Nathan?	He can't get up, Mama!
Be good and be smart, little boy.	Yes, ma'm...
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.	Come in, children.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.	When you read it we'll talk about it...
When you read it we'll talk about it...	Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .	Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?	No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 	Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?	No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.	But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.	If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.	But, Miss Boatwright, you--
But, Miss Boatwright, you--	I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
Come, I'll take you home.	I'll walk...
I'll walk...	Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.	I'm used to it.
Hello, David...	Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.	And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.	They probly thought you was crazy.
They probly thought you was crazy.	I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.	What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?	He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?	Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!	Whatcha got there?
Whatcha got there?	Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.	Well, let me have it.
Well, let me have it.	Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.	Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?	Maybe soon--
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?	Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.	Is he gon' be gone long?
Is he gon' be gone long?	Might be...
Mama, what was we laughin' for?	At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.	I brought these walnuts to trade.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.	I wanta get some things.

I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--	I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.	Whatcha wanta order?
Whatcha wanta order?	I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.	The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Hi ya, Rebecca...	Tired.
Tired.	Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?	Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Night, son!	And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.	I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!	The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Good mornin', Nathan.	Mornin'...
Mornin'...	You ready to eat?
You ready to eat?	I'll wait till after the children.
How's the weather out there?	Little chilly.
Little chilly.	Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!	Ike, you could make a song outta that!
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!	Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
What did he want?	To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!	Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?

You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?	Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.

But, Nathan--	Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.	It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.	I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.

Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.	It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.	Is that a blessing, Reverend?

The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>

WHAT?	Are you sure, Kenny?
Thank you, Kenny.	Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.	Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Oh dear God...	What is 'fisting'?
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!	He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!	YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?	Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!	We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Shiteater-	-Or monkey fucker-
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.

Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.	Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!	Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!

What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?	No, it was worse than that...
No, it was worse than that...	The F word?!
The F word?!	No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!	What is Terrance and Phillip?
What is Terrance and Phillip?	Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!	Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
We must take action on this immediately.	Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.	Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!	Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.	But I-
But I-	You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
How is the children's progress?	Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.	What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?	Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.	Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.	I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.	Alright, I'll make the call...
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!	Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.	Oh yeah!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!	A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
It's from your mother.	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?	It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'

Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?	You bet, Terrance!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!	I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Conan!	Hello, Brooke Shields!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.	Cheers, Terrance!

The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?	Don't believe the hype!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.	Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Oh, you are such a maroon!	You would know, dummy.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.	I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.	I know, Terrance. I know.
What's going on Terrance?	Canada is saving us!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!	You did? Just now?
AGH!	Terrance! NO!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!	Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!	You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!	Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!	Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.	Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?	Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.	Hey, come here, guy.
Who's my cream puff?	I am.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.	I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!	Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!	No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!	Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.	Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You know I do.	I know.
I know.	So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?

You don't care.	Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.	Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.	That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!

Hey, I'm missing the party!	No! It can't be!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!	Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.	Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?

Hi Wendy.	Hi Stan.

Getting drunk is no solution.	Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
I think we're moving.	Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.

Oh, thank you.	Magnificent, magnificent.
Magnificent, magnificent.	Well I appreciate that.
Well I appreciate that.	So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?	Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.	Of course, of course...
Of course, of course...	So...
So...	Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.	Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?	It certainly is.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.	I'm sure I will.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.	Very professional of you.
Where the hell did you come from?	Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Weren't you down in the dining room?	I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.	Oh he did, did he?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -	You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?	I did nothing to the monitors.
And what are they doing now, Mac?	They are awaiting further information.
Were you going to give it to them?	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.	Well you did the right thing Mac.
On channel 10?	The device has stopped responding.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.	My...wings...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.	I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.	There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.	And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.	Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.	Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
What did you say to me?	It's a little late for you to be up.
It's a little late for you to be up.	Look answer my question!
All too well, captain.	Well shut it off at once!
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.	Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?	Well it's a good thing that I did.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?	There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?	Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.	Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.	All right, I'll give it a shot.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.	Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
So, are you on for the next one?	I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.	Why, didn't they say?
Why, didn't they say?	Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.	You want to go back to shuttle work?
You want to go back to shuttle work?	It's steady, good benefits.
You gotta think of your old age.	That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.	Thank you.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.	Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?	Uh...
I think I can handle it.	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?	No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.	Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.	I can hardly wait.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
If anyone can hear me please respond!	That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?	Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.	What is the condition of the bridge?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?	Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!	Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.	What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -	Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?	You better start making sense!
You better start making sense!	Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.	Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!	I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!	Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.	We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?	Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.	Will you transmit the distress signal?
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?	Taylor, you surprise me.
I don't know what you're talking about!	Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!	I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?	Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
Idiot...	Good help is hard to find...
Barnes?	That's me.
That's me.	Break it down to me, what's going on?
Break it down to me, what's going on?	Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.	Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.	Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.	Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?	I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.	10-4 good buddy.
It's time we lock coordinates.	I know, I know.
So, what are we waiting for?	Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.	Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?	The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!	Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!	Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?	I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!	Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!	Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.	This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Is that clear?	That's clear.
That's clear.	Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.	Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!	Over and out!
Look at this...Jesus.	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.	No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.	Like that piece of ass he was with.
Like that piece of ass he was with.	Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.	Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.	I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
What's the use...we're gonna die...	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
It's getting hard to breathe...	Just don't move around too much.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.	That's right.
That's right.	Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?	Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?	This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
So you were looking for a new challenge.	Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.	Like open an airlock by mistake?
Like open an airlock by mistake?	Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.	Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.	I'm sure you'll be all right.
I'm sure you'll be all right.	Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.	Really?
Really?	Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
What are we going to do?	I don't know.
We don't.	Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.	Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?	Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.	Well maybe we can do something like that.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?	Just considering our options... sir.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?	It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.	Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?	With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
OK...it's open.	Seen one like it before?
Seen one like it before?	Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.	Great.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -	Why can't we?
Why can't we?	I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.	You're right.
He certainly is polite.	Close every door behind you!
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.	Even if we do, it might be too late.
Everyone just stay put.	Wait.
I can't let you do that.	Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.	Simulated space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.	I understand.
Are you ready?	Ready as I'll ever be.
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Explosive?	One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Taylor?	Yeah?
Yeah?	What do you think's going to happen to us?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.	Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Do you want some advice?	Sure.
Sure.	Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.	Words to live by.
Dawn!  Dawn!	Helllp!
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
Oh my God.  What happened?	The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
What's that?	A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.	We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.	That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Take this flare.	A flare?  A flare won't do it.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.	No...
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?	Why?  Where are you going?
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?
What?  What are you talking about?	There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
And what are you going to do?!	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.	But how are you going to escape?
But how are you going to escape?	Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.	But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!	I can't!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.	You too.
Dawn.  Come in.	Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm in the bridge.	Barnes?
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.	I'm about to blow the wall.
I'm about to blow the wall.	Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!	How does the distress signal look?
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.	I'll do my best.
I'll do my best.	So what's going to happen to you?
So what's going to happen to you?	I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.	Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?	Hopefully sooner than later.
Hopefully sooner than later.	Sooner than later.
Sooner than later.	Over and out.
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!
We have room!  Let's go!	What do you mean?  What happened!
What do you mean?  What happened!	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
So close...	And so far.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.	It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.	Except write our wills.
Will you marry me?	Marry you?
Marry you?	That's right.  Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.	It would matter to us.
In that case, I accept.	Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...	Try not to think about it.
What is it?!	I don't know.  Wave to them!
I'm fine.	Congratulations on your...recent award.
Congratulations on your...recent award.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Is there anything I can help you with?
Is there anything I can help you with?	No, just enjoying the view.
No, just enjoying the view.	Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.	So I've been told.
So I've been told.	Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.	That is one of my priorities.
What is happening around here!!!	There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!	Where's Taylor?
Where's Taylor?	He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Carlo!	He's in the bathroom.
I'm going back for Taylor!	Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
I'm homesick.	Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!	We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.	Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.	How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?	Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.	I guess so.
I guess so.	Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...	Send it back if you don't want it.
Well now what are we gonna do!	How am I supposed to know?
How am I supposed to know?	You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!	Talk to him...Jesus...
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!	Baby, take it easy.
Baby, take it easy.	How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.	Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.	Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.	I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!	What are you going to do about it?
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?	Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.	What makes you so sure?
What the hell is that?	The engines!
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?	Mac.  What's shaking?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -	Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --	Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.	Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.	Right, I understand that...
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.	That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.	Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.	Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.	I know but we're in a bind.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?	One moment please...  one moment please...
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?	Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?	I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.	Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
How is it looking, Mac?	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Is it safe for human transport?	That's affirmative.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.	You're not from around here, are you?
You're not from around here, are you?	I'm from Akron.
I'm looking for a man.	What kind of man?
What kind of man?	A bowler.
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.	Find your bowler?
Find your bowler?	Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.	My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.	Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.	The pin machine?
The pin machine?	Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
You a mini-golfer?	Nope.
Nope.	Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.	Can I get you something for the road?
Can I get you something for the road?	You have orange whips?
You have orange whips?	Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?	No. I'm from Akron.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?	Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.	Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.	It belonged to my dad.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?	He's my dad.
Heh, heh, heh.	You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
Sorry about your loss.	I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.	You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.	It's splitsville for you.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?	No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	What do you want with old man Faz?
Yeah, basement bingo.	Lemme see your ball.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Three whips. To go.	When you get a chance.
Hey, you still here?	We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.	Are you guys bruddas?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?	I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.	Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.	So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.	La da da dalala...
La da da dalala...	I hate fuckin' opera.
I hate fuckin' opera.	How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!	How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?	You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.	You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.	It was a clearance.
You know, Elvis bowled.	No kiddin'.
No kiddin'.	Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 	gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.	Sure, Sid.
Sure, Sid.	But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -	- canker sore.
- canker sore.	Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
How do you turn this thing off?	Wait! That's an aria!
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!	Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.	Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?	Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.	Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.	Think he bought it?
Think he bought it?	I'd buy it!
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.	Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.	See ya 'round Faz.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.	You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.	Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.	Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
You look like you're something on the lanes.	Theo's bowled on the tour.
Theo's bowled on the tour.	Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
What's on your mind, Miles?	We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?	Seven years.
This scam we got going here was your 	brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.	It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.	A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.	Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.	Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.	I'm sure you have Buzz.
I'm sure you have Buzz.	Wish me luck.
Buzz Fazeli.	Theo.
Theo.	I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.	I'm not on the tour this year.
I'm not on the tour this year.	Need some advice, huh.
Need some advice, huh.	Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.	Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.	They suspended me for 100 years.
They suspended me for 100 years.	100 years! 
100 years! 	I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.	What do you think I can do?
What do you think I can do?	I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.	Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?	I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.	Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.	Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.	That game was before you was born.
That game was before you was born.	My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.	Thanks.
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.
It's mine.	Who gave it to you?
Who gave it to you?	Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner.	Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?	She's my mom.
Who are you? Who sent you here?	I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.	You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.	I got a right. You're my father.
I got a right. You're my father.	I ain't nobody's father!
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.	You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.	What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?	You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.	She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.	I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo.	Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 	kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.	Putt-putt golf?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.	The small ball.
The small ball.	It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.	Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.	If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.	Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?
What's it look like to you?	It looks like dwarf bowling.
I do what I gotta do to survive.	You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.	I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.	I'm your blood.
I'm your blood.	You wish!
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.	Don't say that about my mom!
Don't say that about my mom!	I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.	Fuck you and fuck bowling.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.	That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.	I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.	You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.	I'm getting to like it here.
I'm getting to like it here.	Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?	I gotta survive.
I gotta survive.	He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.	You got a better offer?
You got a better offer?	No...
No...	I didn't think so.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.	That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.	You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.	I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.	Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.	I couldn't care less.
We ain't married no more.	He says that to all his wives.
The whole world thinks you're underground.	I am underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.	I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.	What about bowling?
What about bowling?	Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.	You're a scumbag.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.
I never saw you.	Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?	I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.	Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.	I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.

He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.	See ya 'round Maynard.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!	Clam it!
He's the guy Buzz.	He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.	I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.	Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.	You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.	Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.	We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Son?	Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
My poor baby!	You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello?	Hello, mom?
Hello, mom?	Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?	I found dad.
I found dad.	He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.	Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.	You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?	I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Don't tell me, John.	Cool!
Cool!	Theo. Howzitgoin.
Theo. Howzitgoin.	Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.	How's that?
How's that?	I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?

Uh...over easy.	I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
I don't like to talk about it.	You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?	It depends.
It depends.	It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Knock-knock.	Who's there?
Who's there!	Buzz Fazeli.
Buzz Fazeli.	NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.	Who's there?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.	You shouldn't touch her.
You shouldn't touch her.	No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.	Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.	What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.	He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.	What did you do to Buzz?
What did you do to Buzz?	You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 	I don't want to play.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.	Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.	Who's there?
Who's there?	Junior.
Junior.	Junior who?
Junior who?	J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -	SHEILA!
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.	Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.	We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.	You made me hurt him!
I have someone for you to play with Junior.	Someone wants to play with me?
Someone wants to play with me?	I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.	Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.	It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?	If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.	If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.	No!
No!	I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.	You know who I am?
You know who I am?	Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.	I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.	You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.	Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.	What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?	It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.	That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 	Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.	Nice set-up.
Nice set-up.	If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.	What if he wants to get out?
What if he wants to get out?	He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.	What ever happened to just bowling?
What ever happened to just bowling?	There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.	I like the sport the way it is.
I like the sport the way it is.	A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.	How Mr. Kastle?
How Mr. Kastle?	You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.	Why would you help me?
Why would you help me?	I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.	I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Where's Junior?	He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.	Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.	See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.	After we eat, Dad.
After we eat, Dad.	He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!	That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!	She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!	Look who's talking!
Look who's talking!	Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!	Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Fantastic! What talent.	You still got the touch Junior.
Don't go near the bowling alley.	Bowling "Center"!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.	Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?	132, 154.
132, 154.	You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.	She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!	Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?	That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.	Grasp firmly. Then what?
Grasp firmly. Then what?	Line up where you want it.
Line up where you want it.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Now swing it out a little to the right...
Now swing it out a little to the right...	Like this?
Like this?	No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.

Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!	Yippy!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?	Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Who wants to know?  Zeus!	I'm a bowler.
I'm a bowler.	I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Get that outta your mouth!	They suspended me.
He's not here.	I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.	This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.	I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.	Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.	He's my father, Millie.
He's my father, Millie.	He's no father to you.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.	Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?	The Peter Pan.
What's your specialty?	Whips...orange whips.
Whips...orange whips.	Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.	How do you want it?  The eggs.
How do you want it?  The eggs.	Uh...over easy.
Uh...over easy.	Coming right up.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?	Mine, and they never tip.
Do you know where they're taking him?	Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.	I'm not here to - I can't...
I came here to have a word with your dad.	What do you want with my dad?
What do you want with my dad?	Business.
Business.	Won't your father help you with that?
Won't your father help you with that?	Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.	Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
This is a vicious cycle.	I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.	Isn't this technically a scooter?
Isn't this technically a scooter?	When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.

Everything has it's drawbacks.	Where did your brother escape from?
Where did your brother escape from?	The mental hospital.
The mental hospital.	What does he do?
What does he do?	He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...	Whoa.
Whoa.	It's a vicious cycle.
Mind if I cut in?	No, not at all.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.	The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.	Can I ask you something personal?
Can I ask you something personal?	I'd rather you didn't.
I'd rather you didn't.	Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a girlfriend?	Not while I'm in training.
Not while I'm in training.	Do you have a boyfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?	No. Do You?
No. Do You?	No. Not at the present.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?	Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.	Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.	So, what about you?
So, what about you?	Do I want you?
Do I want you?	We'll get into that later.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?	I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.	I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.

No, I'm fascinated.	Why were you suspended?
Why were you suspended?	I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.	So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?	Well, that was plan A.

Nothing.	Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.	He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.	What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.	Sheila, please.
Sheila, please.	Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?	What's plan C?
What's plan C?	Plan C...  ...is me.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.	Really? I kinda like it.
Do you talk with your mom?	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.	My mom told me not to stay in this town.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.	So why do you stay?
So why do you stay?	I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.	I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.

Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.	I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.	How much would you charge me for the lips?
How much would you charge me for the lips?	More than you could afford.
More than you could afford.	Come on, bargain with me.
Come on, bargain with me.	I could let them go for ten.
I could let them go for ten.	You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.	If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
What are you going to do about your brother?	You're here.
You're here.	What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...	...lane six. Yes.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?	Nope, I couldn't care less.
Nope, I couldn't care less.	I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?	Why should I help that old fuck.
Why should I help that old fuck.	Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?	Zip.
Zip.	And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.	Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?

It's Junior, isn't it.	I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.	He's my father.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.	You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.	I'll be at the bridge.
You told Junior that we did it.	It?
It?	It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.	I told him you were my boyfriend.
I told him you were my boyfriend.	What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!	We would have sooner or later.
We would have sooner or later.	Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.	Did you - kill him?
How do you get this thing down?	Tell me what happened Theo.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.	He's dead Sheila.
He's dead Sheila.	I feel sick.
I feel sick.	You should.
You should.	Are you sure he's dead?
Are you sure he's dead?	I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Where are you going?	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.	Can I come with you?
Can I come with you?	I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Why did you come back?	When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.	If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.	I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.	You don't get two chances with Junior.
You don't get two chances with Junior.	At least I'll die smiling.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.	Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Theo, Buzz is dead.	I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.	Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.	I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.	Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.	SSHHEEIILLAAA!
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?	Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.

You're really pissing me off.	I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?	My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?	What about plan C?
What about plan C?	Fuck plan C!
Fuck plan C!	Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.	You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?	I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.	Sez you!
Sez you!	Suck my dick!
Very professional.	I am a professional man.
I am a professional man.	Lips still for sale?
Lips still for sale?	You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.

Lane's closed big fellah, league night.	I'm not here to bowl.
I'm not here to bowl.	You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?	I'm looking for somebody.
Some unfinished business.	If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
You guys got something going on downstairs?	We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.

Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!	Tell your little pal to let go.
Tell your little pal to let go.	Breeze, give him his ball back!
Very good, busyboy.	Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.	What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.	So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.	You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.	Your time is up, busyboy.
Your time is up, busyboy.	Who identified the body?
Who identified the body?	The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.	I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.	Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.	Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.	Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!	Please, Dr. Levine.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!	Open it, Captain!
Open it, Captain!	Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.	Fletcher, I want you back here.
Fletcher, get away from there...	It's burning...
It's burning...	Get out of there!
Get out of there!	I can't see...
I can't see...	Fletcher!  Now!
Fletcher!  Now!	I can't...
How big is this spacecraft?	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
In basic English, what does all this mean?	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.
Back away then.	Wait a minute --
Wait a minute --	I said back away.
I said back away.	Would you wait a minute?
Hold on --	What is it?
What is it?	Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.	How about I just press the button?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.	Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Norman!	Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.	How long will that be?
They told me about sixty hours.	Two and a half days?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.	Yeah.  I heard you.
Yeah.  I heard you.	There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.	Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move.	But she's --
But she's --	Nobody move!
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Nice work, Captain sir.	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Direction's east coming!	What was that?
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.	What if it attacks?
What if it attacks?	Fifty yards and closing.
Fifty yards and closing.	What do we use for defense?
What do we use for defense?	We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.	High Voltage?
High Voltage?	It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.	Forty yards.
Forty yards.	But you've tested it?
But you've tested it?	Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.	Thirty yards.
Thirty yards.	What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Where is it?	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
What was that?	He's right beneath us.
Increase positive pressure!	That's our reserve air.
That's our reserve air.	It's either that or we grow gills.
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.	Norman, don't do it!
Don't do it!	Now!
Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!
Thank you, Colonel.	Captain.
Captain.	Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.	Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.	The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.	What team?
What have you been told so far?	The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.	Anything else?
Anything else?	Nothing else.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?	Press?  No, I haven't.
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.	From what?  What's with all the security?
From what?  What's with all the security?	Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
We're moving fast considering the storm.	Storm?  What storm?
Storm?  What storm?	A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.	They didn't tell me anything.
How deep is he?	A thousand feet.
A thousand feet.	A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.	Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.	Then why am I here?
Then why am I here?	What?
What?	What do you need me for?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?	Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?	As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.	Geologists?
Geologists?	Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --	-- Wait a second --
-- Wait a second --	-- dating the crash at least that old.
-- dating the crash at least that old.	Hold on --
Hold on --	Maybe older --
Maybe older --	-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.	Extraordinary, isn't it?
Extraordinary, isn't it?	It's impossible.
It's impossible.	I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.	It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make any sense.	We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.	What team?
What team?	The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.	ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.	But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
They pressurize us with helium.	What's wrong with oxygen?
What's wrong with oxygen?	It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
What is it, Norman?	Take a look.
Picked up something?  What is it?	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
Maybe we shouldn't.	What?
What?	If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.	You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?	I don't know.  That's the point.
I don't know.  That's the point.	Everything can be killed.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.	I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.	Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.	All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.	Just worry about yourself.
Harry's missing.	What do you mean, he's missing?
What do you mean, he's missing?	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.	He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.	But sir --
But sir --	No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.	How drastic?
How drastic?	You don't want to know.
You don't want to know.	I think I do.
I think I do.	A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.

She should've known better.	She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.	When was this?
When was this?	'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.	So you knew this when you wrote your report?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?	At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.	You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --	Wait a second --
Wait a second --	-- and then brought her down here --
-- and then brought her down here --	-- I didn't know it would come to this --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --	-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."	The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.	What am I -- a dog, now?
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.	That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.	You don't think weapons are important?
You don't think weapons are important?	I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Edmunds?	Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...	Damn it, Edmunds?
Damn it, Edmunds?	... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?	Edmunds?  Can you copy?
What for?	If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.	At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.	But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
You think he killed Edmunds?	Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.	Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.	Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.	No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Going active.	Jerry?
What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.	Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I see it.	Pull it.
Can you open that panel?	Working on it now, sir.
It's not sucking, sir.	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.	We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.	Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
What caused it?	Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --	Harry?  Can you copy?
Subs are still at surface, sir.	Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.	They're coming.
Any sign of Harry?	Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.	Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?
Well, where the fuck is he?	In the ship, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...	They've left, keep watching!
They've left, keep watching!	Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.	In a minute, sir.
How much damage?	To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.	Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?	I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's chipped.	Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?	I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.	I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?	I did.
I did.	Then how can it be chipped?
Ted?  Captain?	Yes, Harry.
Yes, Harry.	We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.	So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.	What?
What?	To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.	A break for what?
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.	The what?
So?  What's the problem?	It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.	It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.	You don't know that.
You don't know that.	Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.	Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Gimme a report, I want --	Ladies and Gentlemen...
Ladies and Gentlemen...	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?	Please watch your closest monitor...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.	We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.	What's the message?
What's the message?	I have to tell you.  It's strange.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.	How do you mean, strange?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.	It's not ignorant.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.	He understands me fine.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?	She's not gonna know, sir.
What?	He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.	I'm in charge.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".	What -- you want me to retype it?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.	She's not gonna know.
She's not gonna know.	She wired this system.
She wired this system.	If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
A half a mile long?	The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.	Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
I'd also like it noted --	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?	What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Ted, get her away from the door.	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Look at this.	What is it?
Some sort of lead or something.	Radiation shield, you think?
Radiation shield, you think?	A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What's wrong?	What do you make of this?
We had considered it.	Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?	Maybe we didn't want to come back.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.	Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.	What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Did you hear me, sir, because --	Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
How can he be missing?	Sir, about leaving --
Sir, about leaving --	We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
They switched us over.	To what?
To what?	Internal power.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.	Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
From the sphere?	What's inside the sphere.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.	Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --	I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.	Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Edmunds?	Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
What is that?	The sensors are picking up something outside.
The sensors are picking up something outside.	What?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.	Too big?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?	What was Edmunds doing outside?
What was Edmunds doing outside?	Resetting the sub.
Resetting the sub.	What sub?
What sub?	In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?	I love secrets.
I love secrets.	That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?	I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.	That's quite a secret.
That's quite a secret.	I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.	C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.	Because when we get down there --
Because when we get down there --	Wait -- down where?
Wait -- down where?	To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.	Underwater?
Underwater?	What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?	We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.	Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.	It never occurred to me.
It never occurred to me.	Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?	The timing has never seemed quite right.
The timing has never seemed quite right.	Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.	What -- are you threatening me?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?	Yeah.  Drowning.
You're next, Norman.	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.	Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.	Good theory, Ted.
Norman!	Get this thing off me.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Where'd this come from?	The library.
The library.	We have a library?
We have a library?	A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.	No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.	My gosh, Norman.
My gosh, Norman.	Yeah, it was awful.
Yeah, it was awful.	What about you?  What happened to you?
What about you?  What happened to you?	Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?	Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.	What do you mean -- not normal?
What do you mean -- not normal?	They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.	Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.	What?
What?	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?	Yeah, why?
Yeah, why?	And you didn't tell anyone?
What?  Why...	Beth --
Beth --	I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --	They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?	What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --	Beth.
Beth.	Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?	Beth --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...	Beth.
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.	She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.	What could have done this?
Norman.	What are they?
What are they?	Eggs.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.	C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.	Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.	So what?
So what?	So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --	Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."	Where did you get this?
Where did you get this?	In Edmunds' things.
In Edmunds' things.	You went through Edmunds' things?
You went through Edmunds' things?	He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.	Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?	Don't tell me to calm down!
Don't tell me to calm down!	It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?
What?	You told him about me?
Beth --	You did, didn't you?
You did, didn't you?	Don't do this.
Don't do this.	You bastard.
You bastard.	Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.	Beth --
Beth --	No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Where are you going in such a hurry?	I have to reset the sub.
Forget the sub.	Don't bother me, Norman.
Don't bother me, Norman.	It's not worth the risk.
It's not worth the risk.	It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.	You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry?	You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --	We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.	Four days?
Four days?	Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.	Why should I go?
Why should I go?	You should know how it works.  Just in case.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.	In case you die, too?
In case you die, too?	I don't trust Harry to do it.
I don't trust Harry to do it.	I would.  But my suit --
I would.  But my suit --	I fixed your suit.
You fixed my suit?	You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?	But I don't know how --
But I don't know how --	You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?	I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?	Still clear.
What's the matter?	You fixed this suit?  Beth?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?	Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.	My air isn't... I'm coming back.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.	You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear?	Still clear.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?	Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.	Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.	He what?
You get it straightened out?	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?	Fixing it.
Fixing it.	Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?	The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.	The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.	It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.	That wasn't in there before.
That wasn't in there before.	We must've had it delivered then.
We must've had it delivered then.	Wait a second --
Wait a second --	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.	None of this was here before.
None of this was here before.	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.	No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.	You think?
You think?	You don't believe me.
You don't believe me.	All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --	Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.	This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.	You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?	I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.	Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
Page 87.	What?
What?	Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...	Squids?
Squids?	"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.	Manifested?
Manifested?	Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
He translated it wrong.	What?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.	What do you mean, a part of Harry?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?	When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.	You think, in the sphere --
You think, in the sphere --	He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.	But how?
But how?	I don't know.
I don't know.	How can the sphere do that?
How can the sphere do that?	I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...	Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Which I told Barnes was attacking --	It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.	But why is he doing it?
But why is he doing it?	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.	His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?	No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.	Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Looks like some sort of code.	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Diphenyl parlene.	Something for burns.
Something for burns.	Ephedrine hydrochloride.
It's for motion sickness.	Valdomet.
Valdomet.	Ulcers.
Ulcers.	Sintag.
Sintag.	A synthetic opium analogue.
A synthetic opium analogue.	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.	Nothing about drowsiness.
Nothing about drowsiness.	Tarazine?
Tarazine?	Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.	Bingo.
Bingo.	"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Riordan?	Antihistamine.  For bites.
Antihistamine.  For bites.	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?	Antibiotic.
Antibiotic.	Parasolutrine?
Parasolutrine?	How do you spell it?
How do you spell it?	P-a-r-a-s-o...
P-a-r-a-s-o...	It's a soporific.
It's a soporific.	What's that?
What's that?	Causes sleep.
Causes sleep.	It's like a sleeping pill?
It's like a sleeping pill?	"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "	How long does it last?
How long does it last?	Three to six hours.
Three to six hours.	I'll just boost the doses.
I'll just boost the doses.	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?	How fast does it take effect?
How fast does it take effect?	Doesn't say.
Doesn't say.	What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
It's an idea.	Beth --
Beth --	To be on the safe side.  I mean --
To be on the safe side.  I mean --	You want to kill him?
You want to kill him?	Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
You ever given an injection before.	Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?	Only lab rats.  Here.
I'm sorry.	For what?
For what?	Not believing you.
Not believing you.	You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?
Where are you?	In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
The sphere looks different.	What do you mean, different?
What do you mean, different?	The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.	How's Harry?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.
Your watch.	Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.
I'm feeling better.	Are you?
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?
You think I'd really drink that?	You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.	I did do that, didn't I?
How do you feel about snakes?	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?	You know what I mean.
You know what I mean.	Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.	What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.	You tell me.
You tell me.	Do you fear them?
Do you fear them?	Don't you?
Don't you?	Are you manifesting them?
Are you manifesting them?	If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?	Did you?
Did you?	What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?	Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.	Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.	No, he isn't.
No, he isn't.	He can't manifest.
He can't manifest.	No, he can't.
No, he can't.	Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?	You think I manifested the snakes?
You think I manifested the snakes?	Someone did.
Someone did.	Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.	C'mon -- what?
C'mon -- what?	You're lying --
You're lying --	Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?	But --
But --	And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.	That's when you went in the sphere.
That's when you went in the sphere.	One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.	You manifested that, Beth.
You manifested that, Beth.	Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.	You're insane.
You're insane.	Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?	I never went in that sphere.
I never went in that sphere.	You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.	Yes.
Yes.	You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.	That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.	Is it?
Is it?	Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.	No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?	Shut up, Beth --
Shut up, Beth --	When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?	It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.	"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
Don't, Beth.	But I have to, Norman.
But I have to, Norman.	I promise --
I promise --	Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!	Beth --
Beth --	You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.	Don't, Beth.  Please.
Don't, Beth.  Please.	It's either this... or I kill you.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.	It's not safe for you to be either.
It's not safe for you to be either.	You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.	Get away from the door, Beth.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.	Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.	I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Beth!	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Where is it coming from, Beth?	Don't you know?
Beth, stop it!	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Then where's it coming from?	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Stop it!	It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Beth?	Leave me alone, Norman.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.	I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.	Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.	I --
I --	Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.	Beth -- gimme the gun.
Beth -- gimme the gun.	Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.	C'mon --
C'mon --	Top shelf, is it?
Top shelf, is it?	Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
What is that?  What are you doing?	What?
What?	You hear that?
You hear that?	Hear what?
Hear what?	Get away from me!
Get away from me!	Beth --
Beth --	Get away --
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.	How's that?
How's that?	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Pussy.	What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
No.  I don't think so.	Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.	Well, they're not mine.
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
Well, what's your theory?	I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
Norman?  Where's Norman?	By the bunks.
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?	All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.	For who?  The fish?
For who?  The fish?	For whoever's in that thing.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?	You'd have to ask them.
Then what is it?	It's an American spacecraft.
What are you looking for?	A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...	Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.	I never said that.
I never said that.	Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.	We never even had a conversation, Norman.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.	Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.	I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Just in time, too.	In time for what?
In time for what?	What?
What?	Just in time for what?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.	Another attack?
Why are you looking at me like that?	Like what?  I'm not --
Like what?  I'm not --	You're staring at me.
You're staring at me.	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
No I'm not.  I'm not star--	Yes you are...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.	We can refuse to talk.
We can refuse to talk.	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
When did it come across?	Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.	Where's it coming from?
Where's it coming from?	No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.	Is it coming from our own computer?
Is it coming from our own computer?	Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?
What?	You holding up alright?
You holding up alright?	Fine.  I'm fine.
Fine.  I'm fine.	Don't be defensive.
Don't be defensive.	I'm not being defensive.
I'm not being defensive.	You sound defensive.
You sound defensive.	I'm fine.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.	No, why don't --
C'mon.	Wait a second, I --
C'mon, Norman.	Look, would you --
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.	To what?
To what?	Time travel.  A black hole.
This answers one of our questions.	Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.	This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.	But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.	Our present.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?	Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.	Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.	I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?	Not a clue.
Not a clue.	A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.	I don't follow you.
I don't follow you.	On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.	So what?
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.	Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.	Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.	Gimme another explanation.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.	Am I?
Am I?	Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.	You mean, you think I'm cracking?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?	No.  I didn't say that.
No.  I didn't say that.	Then what, Norman?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.	Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What is that?  That noise?	What noise?
What noise?	It's like...
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?	What are you still doing here?
What are you still doing here?	You remember opening the door?
You remember opening the door?	You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.	Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?	You don't understand about the sphere.
You don't understand about the sphere.	Then explain it to me.
Norman?	What is it, Harry?
What is it, Harry?	What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?	Page 87 of what, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?	I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.	That far in what, Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.	What are they?
Getting anywhere with those?	There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.	Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?	Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.	You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.	Did I?
Did I?	You don't remember that?
You don't remember that?	I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
... you there?  Norman?	Harry?
Harry?	Norman, where are you?
Norman, where are you?	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?	You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --	What happened to her?
What happened to her?	What do you mean?  She's not here?
What do you mean?  She's not here?	When I woke up, nobody was here.
When I woke up, nobody was here.	She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.	Her suit's gone.
Her suit's gone.	Beth left?
Beth left?	I thought she was with you.
She's cracking, Norman.	You didn't say that about the food?
You didn't say that about the food?	I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.	But why would she -- ?
But why would she -- ?	She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Wisconsin's your answer.	Wisconsin?
Wisconsin?	Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.	How do we decode it?
How do we decode it?	Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.	The three of us.
The three of us.	That's right.
That's right.	Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
It's the squid!  Stop it!	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Fine.	Help me lift her.
We're never gonna make it.	Shut up and open the door.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?	Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.	How far away's the sub?
I can't reach her.	Hold on.
Push her, c'mon.	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Missed.	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.	I heard!  I heard!
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --	Shut up and catch.
C'mon, Norman!	I'm trying to keep balance with --
I'm trying to keep balance with --	Gimme a second --
Gimme a second --	Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!	Her legs are in the way.
Her legs are in the way.	You got her?
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?	I'm trying.  There.
You know how to work this thing?	No idea.
No idea.	Well, press something!
Well, press something!	Wait!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.	Nine hundred feet to surface.
Nine hundred feet to surface.	It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
How's that working out, by the way?	Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.	No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
There is one possibility.	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?	You mean forget?
You mean forget?	It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
What'd you say to him?	To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.	What does Norman already know?
What does Norman already know?	Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
She told me what you said, Norman.	What is it, Harry?
What is it, Harry?	Just one of Norman's many secrets.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?	You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.	Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...	Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
English?	That's right.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.	Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?	A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.	But it's impossible.
But it's impossible.	Is it?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?	Think about it.
Think about it.	Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.	Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.	Do you?
Do you?	If it is an alien spacecraft --
If it is an alien spacecraft --	Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.	It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.	Meaning?
Meaning?	Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.	Please.  It must have flown here --
Please.  It must have flown here --	It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.	Arrived?  From where?
Arrived?  From where?	Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.	Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.	Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.	Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
Well, if it's a discharge --	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.	Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?	See?  No code.  What'd I say?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?	Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
What'd you say?	"We are friends".
Good idea, Ted.	Thank you.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.	It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Norman Johnson.	Does this mean what I think it means?
Does this mean what I think it means?	It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.	The ships?
The ships?	They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
How are the others?	The others, sir?
The others, sir?	Beth and Harry?
Beth and Harry?	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...	What was that, sir?
What was that, sir?	About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?	No, they didn't say --
No, they didn't say --	This way, sir.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.	Captain who?
Captain who?	Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.	Really?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.	What report?
What report?	You mean they haven't told you yet?
You mean they haven't told you yet?	Told me what?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.	Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.	You've heard of me?
You've heard of me?	Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.	What report?
What report?	Huh?
Huh?	What report?
What report?	You mean you don't know?
You mean you don't know?	Know what?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.	Who's everyone?
Who's everyone?	Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.	Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?	Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.	What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He wasn't feeling well.	He's a pussy.
You want me to try?	You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.	Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.	Still, make a note I recognized that.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.	Like what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.	You mean a picture?
You mean a picture?	Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.	I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.	Squint harder.
Squint harder.	Please, Ted.
Please, Ted.	Try this one.
Try this one.	This is like nursery school.
This is like nursery school.	Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.	The creature?
The creature?	Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?	Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Well, he's polite.	Unless it's an act.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?	When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.	Why's that?
What was it?	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.	Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?	Not that I know of.  Why?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?	I'm not sure.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --	Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
What kind of a crash was it?	You seen my suitcase?
You seen my suitcase?	There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?	He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --	In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?	Don't be so supportive, honey.
Don't be so supportive, honey.	Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --	Four.  Four years --
Four.  Four years --	Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.	Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?	How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.	What?
What?	Was it a military crash?
Was it a military crash?	I don't know.
I don't know.	They never used to send a Navy car.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Well, we'll see...	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
The Empire must have gotten here first.	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.	Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.	Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
No, not anymore.	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.	Who's going to pay me then?
Who's going to pay me then?	I think there are some things we should talk about.
I think there are some things we should talk about.	I'm beginning not to like you.
How much do you think she's talking about?	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.	This isn't a game, you know.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.	Fear is their greatest weapon.
Fear is their greatest weapon.	I'm not afraid of anything...
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.	Not bad.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.	All right then, we'll use your plan.
I'll get the information.	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.	Is that good or bad?
Is that good or bad?	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.	There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?	I'm not going out there.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.	We'll be back before you are, old man.
We'll be back before you are, old man.	May the Force be with you.
Good morning!	What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.	Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
Who are you anyway?	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.	I know that.
I know that.	You saw through me?
You saw through me?	You could put it that way.
You could put it that way.	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!

You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.

You mean I generate an energy field?	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!	Could I learn to feel it?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.	How can you store an energy field within you?
How can you store an energy field within you?	When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.

Don't you have a Kiber crystal?	I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...	That's where my father was killed.
That's where my father was killed.	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.

Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?	They use the Bogan Force.
They use the Bogan Force.	Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?	Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?	He's bluffing...
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.

But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
What's wrong?  What's happening?	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you all right?	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Are you sure you don't need it?	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.

What do I do?	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
What is it?	He can't find Organa Major.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.	You mean we should go after her!...
You mean we should go after her!...	I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
I can't see!  How can I fight?	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
What about the princess?	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.	I'm not going alone!
The Kiber Crystal.	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Of course, where you been kid?	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?	The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.

At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.	Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
You're Starkiller?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Have you been checked out?
Have you been checked out?	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.	Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.	What's that?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?	Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Yes, sir, but I can get him...	Forget it, son.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.	Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.	Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?	I'll make a report later.
I'll make a report later.	As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.	Send one squad up.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.	Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!	It could be worse...
Here come six more... grid two!	Was this trip really necessary?
There are only three or four left.	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?

The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.

Where are you taking us now anyway?	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.	I'd better go see how he's doing.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.	Did it occur to you they might find us?
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.	I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.	We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Who's the pilot?	It's automatic.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.	You don't believe in the Force?
You don't believe in the Force?	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
I found it... It's just not there.	What are you saying?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...	Why?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.	Don't you believe it.
Well, I practice a lot...	You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.
Why didn't you say so before.	I think I did.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.	See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
I think she's going to be all right.	Not if this tunnel deadends.
Is he afraid of the water?	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Watch it!  Move back.	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!	Move out of the way!
Get to the ship!	Come back here... Where are you going?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.	Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...	I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...	We'll send a squad up.
We'll send a squad up.	No need, everything's under control.
No need, everything's under control.	With four casualties?!
With four casualties?!	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.	Who is this?  What's your operating...
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.	They'll find its weakness.
They'll find its weakness.	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
No!...	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?	He'll be well cared for.
And you?	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.	I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!	I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.	I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...	Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?	Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.	Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.	I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!	Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.	Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
See Threepio... do you copy?	I read you sir.
I read you sir.	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.	Are you safe?
Are you safe?	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...	See Threepio!  Do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...	Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Are you there, sir?  We're going...	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.	I'd consider it an honor.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.	What an honor...
What an honor...	Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?	Something... I've got...you don't.
Something... I've got...you don't.	You rich kids... are all the same !
You rich kids... are all the same !	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.	Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.	Well, maybe you better look again.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.	It's what I deserve.
It's what I deserve.	Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Whad'ya talkin  about ?	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.	You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.	What do I want with a scar ?
No, this hurts.	YAAAAAAAA !
Mobile Infantery rules !	Death to all bugs !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?	I didn't see him !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...	He was our teacher... He was great.
He was our teacher... He was great.	Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.	What about it, Diz ?
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!	Not enough, I guess.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...	We're the old men, Ace.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.	Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.	Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...	Yes, sir !
Saddle up, Roughnecks !	You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.	Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?	Sir, no, sir.
Sir, no, sir.	Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?	Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?	Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.	Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.	Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.	What's the hurry ?
What's the hurry ?	Others are waiting.
Did you read her mind ?	Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.	You got it bad.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.	Ace of spades.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.	In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
How do you make him do that ?	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?	I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.	Your father will never let you.
Your father will never let you.	I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?	Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Eight point... no, uh, seven...	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.	All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I don't believe it !	I got Games & Theory.
Please continue, Sergeant.	Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...	Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?	Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.	Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.	I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?	I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
You always told me you couldn't do human...	I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Are you alright ?	I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
I'm all ears.	Don't you have to finish the game ?
Johnny, this is Zander.	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?	Only when I give you an order.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.	Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.	Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Or...?	They revoke our flight status.
They revoke our flight status.	Oh, I see... teamwork.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.	Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Profile's wrong... there.	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?	Hey, check it.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...	Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?	Well, whad'ya know...
Well, whad'ya know...	Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.	You and me, huh ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...	Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
WHERE IS IT ?	THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !	It looks like an... asteroid.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Johnny, wait...	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.	Zander, please... Let's go !
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.	You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?	There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...	So ?
So ?	So who's got time to get married ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.	Funny...
Funny...	I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.	Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Carmen...?	Excuse me...!
I'm sorry, Carmen.	Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.	You're upset, that's alright.
Where are you going ?	A funeral.
A funeral.	That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?	Yeah.
Yeah.	How do you feel about him now ?
How do you feel about him now ?	I don't know, Zander.
I don't know, Zander.	I do.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...	Is it true ?
Zander, what are you doing ?	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.	Zander, no...!
Good for you.	Your turn...
She's flying starships !	Who ?
Who ?	Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical	I have good reflexes.
Eeuch !	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...	Excuse me...!
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.	Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?	I don't want everyone to see.
I don't want everyone to see.	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?	It's all I think about anymore.
You can't walk me home.	Why not ?
Why not ?	I thought you were going to help Carl.
I thought you were going to help Carl.	Carl can wait.
Carl can wait.	Johnny, my Dad's home today.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?	Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?	How do I know if this is love ?
How do I know if this is love ?	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.	I'll meet you outside.
None at all... We won.	Good luck at the academy.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?	Yeah, sure, I guess.
Yeah, sure, I guess.	No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.	What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.	Zander is going for pilot, too.
Zander is going for pilot, too.	You two have so much in common.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !	I can't help it.
I can't help it.	He's nothing like you.
He's nothing like you.	I don't even know if you're my girl.
Are you the boy for me ?	I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...	Who cares ?
Who cares ?	You're right. Let's never stop...
I love you, Carmen.	Shhh...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?	Did you get Starside R&D ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !	Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.	I'll go for that.
You're late.	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
You talk to Carl ?	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.	I love you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.	Alright, I love you.
Do you mean it ?	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Shhhh...!	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
What happened to your hair ?	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?	It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.	You don't look very happy to see me.
You don't look very happy to see me.	Should I be ?
Should I be ?	Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
What's wrong with you ?	Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
...I'm sorry.	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.	No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...	That was just a mix up.
That was just a mix up.	You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.	What happened to your eye ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.	I like it. It's kinda...you.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.	How are you, Carl ?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?	See you on the bounce !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !	We've gotta go get her !
Which way ?	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.	Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.	Yes, ma'am !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.	Yes, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.	Thank you, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.	Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?	He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!	Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !	No way, ma'am !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Report.	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Where'd it come from ?	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.	Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!	That's it, we're empty ma'am !
A lot can happen in three minutes.	Hut... hut !
What ?	You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?	Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

You still gonna play for Brazil ?	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.	How come we never got together ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?	Sure.
Sure.	Uh, look, Diz...
Uh, look, Diz...	Guess you gotta go.
Guess you gotta go.	You're the best.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.	No thanks, Diz.
No thanks, Diz.	What's your malfunction, Rico ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.	What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?	You saying you didn't ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.	Flip six, three hole.
Flip six, three hole.	What ?
What ?	High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Cover me.	You got it.
It stinks, you goin.	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.	If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Well, see ya.	You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.	What's that, Diz ?
What's that, Diz ?	That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Way to go, amigo !	I'm gonna need a squad leader.
C'mon...	Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Nah, I don't do that anymore...	You used to dance...
You used to dance...	I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?	Well, excuse me, sir...
Hey, Diz...	What ?
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Diz, see what you can do.	I'm on it !
What frequency ?	All bands.
All bands.	Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !	It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Good good, then it's all settled.	A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !	Teenagers !
...CUT OFF !	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Oh, my, what's that ?	Looks like rain.
Looks like rain.	This time of the year...?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Mr. Rasczak.	Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !	No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.	Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.	I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.	Oh, is that how it is ?
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?	Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...	I won't quit !
I won't quit !	I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !	Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.	They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.	Keep trying, Sergeant.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?	AAAAAAAAAAA !
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...	I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.	Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.	Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.	My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-	Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?	Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?	I wouldn't mind.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.	Good luck. It's not there anymore.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.	Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !	Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, thank you, sir !	Don't stand there dumb... GO !
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?	Sir, yes, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?	Sir, yes it is, sir.
Sir, yes it is, sir.	Doesn't look like it to me.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?	Here in Buenos Aires.
Are your parents currently citizens ?	No, sir.
No, sir.	Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?	Courage, I guess.
Courage, I guess.	Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...	I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...	Aw, don't get mushy.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?	Uh, no.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.	Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Well, yeah, sure...	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!	Hi, mom.
Hi, mom.	Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.	You can never be sure.
Best in the Fleet !	I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?	You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?	Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
On whose authority, Corporal ?	This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !	This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?	You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?	The Rodger Young just burned up...
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
What do you think you're doing ?	I'm gonna save Carmen.
I'm gonna save Carmen.	That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.	Yeah, that's right.
Let's go.	Move out.
Can you walk ?	Not a problem.
Not a problem.	Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...	Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Don't be a hero...	This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !	SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !	What is your position ?
What is your position ?	Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !	Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !	Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?	Uh, I don't know.
Uh, I don't know.	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
Mister Rasczak ?	What is it, Rico ?
What is it, Rico ?	I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.	I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.	Good for you. Go find out.
Good for you. Go find out.	Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?	Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.	I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.
Kill the bitch.	Yes, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?	Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...	Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.	Yes, sir !
Yes, sir !	Who's that with you ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.	Yes, sir.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?	What's going on, Diz ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !	Yes, sir !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !	Cover us, Ace !
Hit your jets, sir !	I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...	We're not leaving you here, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.	Give'em hell, sir !
Who is...'V'ger'...?	V'ger is that which programmed me.
V'ger is that which programmed me.	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Where is Lt. Ilia?	That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?	V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?	To join with him.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.	Who is V'ger?
Who is V'ger?	V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
The examination is a normal function.	You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>...?!	The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.	<U>Why</U>?!
<U>Why</U>?!	The Creator has not answered.
The Creator has not answered.	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.	You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Disclose the information.	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.	They have repressed the Creator.
They have repressed the Creator.	The information will not be disclosed.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Our data is being prepared.	<U>Answer</U>!
<U>Answer</U>!	We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?	Yes.
Yes.	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
What does that mean?	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.	That is logical. You may procede.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.	That is how V'ger will survive.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?	By the Creator.
By the Creator.	To join, and become One with the Creator?
To join, and become One with the Creator?	To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...	'To learn all that is learnable.'
'To learn all that is learnable.'	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle on viewer.	Departure angle.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!	Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!	Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.	Engineering...
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.	You are what...?
You are what...?	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.	-- You, personally, are assuming command?
-- You, personally, are assuming command?	Yes.
Yes.	May I ask Why?
May I ask Why?	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
Programming ready?	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.	Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.	You saved the ship.
You saved the ship.	I'm aware of that, sir.
I'm aware of that, sir.	Stop competing with me, Decker!
Stop competing with me, Decker!	Permission to speak freely, sir?
Permission to speak freely, sir?	Granted.
Granted.	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.	Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.	No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?	Mr Decker....
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!	You asked my opinion, sir.
<U>Computer off</U>!	It's taken control of the computer...!
It's taken control of the computer...!	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.	They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Captain, what's the next move?	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.	Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.	No!
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.	Captain... I'd like to go along...
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...	This served the purpose.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.	It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Forward motion, Captain...!	A tractor beam...
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 	   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.	You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Hello, Ilia.	Decker....!
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Was he difficult?	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...	That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?	If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?	No.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.	Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
'Commander' Decker?	Our Exec and Science Officer...
And in you, too, Lieutenant.	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Time to impact...?	Twelve seconds...!
Twelve seconds...!	Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!	I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Mr. Spock?	Impact in fifteen seconds...
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!	Ten seconds....
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.	Viewer, standard ahead.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?	He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.	Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.	Hold station.
Hold station.	Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.	Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.	Aye, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.	We're already two settings below that, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.	Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
One hundred kilometers...	Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead.	Viewer ahead, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!	Thrusters ahead, one third.
Hold station...!	Thrusters at station keeping...
Clear the bridge, Captain...?	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...	Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...	Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...	Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
We're losing the pattern...!	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.	Sit down, please.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.	I want him here.  Sit down!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.	And whatever you sensed out here....
And whatever you sensed out here....	... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.	I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.	I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!	Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.	Any reply from them?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.	Our... 'insignificance'?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.	But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.	Mr. Decker... ?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!	Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.	Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?	I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
They had a pattern to follow...	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.	Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!	I am seeking answers, Captain.
I am seeking answers, Captain.	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
What should you have known?	No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!	What answers?
What answers?	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!	High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Child...!?	Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?	Precisely.
Not for us?	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...	There is no alternative.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           	The point... 
The point... 	The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...	... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'

You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.	I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.

Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!	No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.	That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...

Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?	In high school.
In high school.	He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.	But Rache...

Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!	You owe me a quarter.
You do NOT run out on your moth...	YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
You know, this horse smells really bad.	There's worse things.
...your hating me.	Cos she loves you.
Cos she loves you.	Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.

Excuse me --	Annabelle let's get something clear.
I made you some cocoa.  See?	Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;	Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.	Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.

Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?	I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.	I have lava.
I have lava.	Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Queen of diamonds.	Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Poof!  You're happy now.	Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?	I knew where I was all the time.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.	No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.	Rachel's job is she works.
Rachel's job is she works.	Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.

Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.	And many meatballs.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.	Is that like Luigi's?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.	Where are you, anyway?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?	Yes.
Yes.	Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.

I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.	Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
That I do.  Always will.	Mom...?
I'm fine, ba...	Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?	Thursday's fine...

No.	Pray.  We never find out.
Mommy's sick, guys.	You have the WORST flu since...
You have the WORST flu since...	I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.	Is your bad?
So you're okay.	I'm still sick, but I'm better.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...	That's Rache's song!
That's Rache's song!	Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...	No!  I have to get there.
No!  I have to get there.	Where Ben?
Where Ben?	Before you.
Before you.	Ben where do you have to get to?
Ben where do you have to get to?	Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.	Oh.

Find the bird cage?	Rache says it's from you.
Rache says it's from you.	Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?	You dying.
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.	But you can still see him.
But you can still see him.	Half.  Of him.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.	So where are you?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.	Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.	Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
It's not good enough.	No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...	You've got a fruit loop in your hair.

People beat it, don't they?  All the time.	Every day.  More and more.

Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...	Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.	Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --

Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...	They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.

You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!	No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.

Something's up wi...	You think I didn't get that?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.	Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --

We're not discussing your age.	Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.	They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.

It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.	I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.	You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...	I'm worried.
I'm worried.	Me too.
Me too.	Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.	Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.	Easy enough.
Easy enough.	Good...Well...Take care.

Not to me.	Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --

Called him.  We set an ap...	Don't do this.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.	Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...	<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
Still, please.	Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.	Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...	Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...	Just not to me.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.	To make it easier for them or you?

We...	WE are over.
WE are over.	WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.	No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.	Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?	And we all went through that together?
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.	Stop.  You're making me insecure.
It's temporary.	It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....	Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.	Yet another spaghetti night.
Yet another spaghetti night.	Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.

Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.	I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.	I was in there in him.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?	No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --	You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.

Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!	Get out!
Get out!	But it's not on the schedule!
But it's not on the schedule!	You got to hell!
Machines do not EAT message.	Look, I...
Look, I...	Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Yeh?	Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.	I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...	You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.	Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...	A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
...in.	I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...	I don't recall inviting you.
I have a snoop.	I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...	I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.	You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...	I need practice.
I need practice.	Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
So why did y...	I did it for her.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.	What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
However many.  It's not enough.	I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.	Fine, forget it.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...	Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Why not just bring the whole toilet?	Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?	Not personally.
Not personally.	Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.	It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
I'm sorry, I just...	Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.	No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?	Anxiety.
Anxiety.	Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --	She was angry at herself.
She was angry at herself.	Jackie?
Jackie?	Yes?
Yes?	When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You feeling all right?	Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.	Wowie.  How wonderful!
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.	Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...	Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
I don't know wh...	I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
My boss.	You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.	You WHAT?
You WHAT?	You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Look, you've never liked me...	Don't flatter yourself.
Don't flatter yourself.	And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...	Nobody likes a snoop.
Nobody likes a snoop.	But I came here to...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...	We can't live like that.
Did I hear the word...	Luke.  Can't live like that.
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...	...it's my problem, too.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.	Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.	You're not dying.
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
How the hell would you know?	I don't, but...
I don't, but...	How would you know <u>anything</u>?
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.	You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
They came out of my <u>body</u>!	See, I know that.
See, I know that.	I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.	Ironic, huh?
Small world.	Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...	You're a cross-dresser.
You're a cross-dresser.	That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
She hasn't mentioned this.	She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Moi?	Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...	...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.	Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
Oh, my God.	Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.	She's devastated.
She's devastated.	Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
And you said...?	Beats me.  Ask your mom.
Can I look at the pictures?	It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
So.  Hopeful.	It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
I really look like shit.	You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.	Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...	Brad Kovitsky.
The primo stuff is great for pain.	I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.	And you said...
And you said...	What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?	Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...	How's she doing with Brad?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...	Thanks, but it's under control.
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...	It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...	...go to the park.  In the worst way.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?	No.
It's just not the right time t...	Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?	It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.	You mean, after I'm dead?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...	Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.	It's the same choice you made.
It's the same choice you made.	Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.	I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...	That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
My advice to you?  Don't die.	Feeling the pressure?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.	And her...?
And her...?	Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...	Is that what he told you?
Is that what he told you?	He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...	Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Looks nice enough to m...	He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.	Are we.
Are we.	And I'm going to win.
And I'm going to win.	Don't be too sure.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?	It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...	Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...	Give 'em my number.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.	Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?	You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?	Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
You put filth in my child's mouth.	Aw.
Aw.	You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!	Worked.  Like a charm.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...	So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.	That's not wh...
That's not wh...	You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?	You weren't passing 'em out.
You weren't passing 'em out.	Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.	Oh please.
Oh please.	Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...	She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.	Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.	And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.	<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Thanks for coming out.	Neutral ground.  What's up?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.	Double.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?	Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...	No, there isn't.
No, there isn't.	And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...	Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...	Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?	Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You're lying.	I lost him.  I was panicked.
I lost him.  I was panicked.	You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!	I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
Ben never mentioned it.	He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Why didn't I?	Uh.  You hate my guts?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.	What do I have that you don't?
What do I have that you don't?	Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...	You're the hip and fresh.
You're the hip and fresh.	You ride with Annabelle...
You ride with Annabelle...	You'll learn.
You'll learn.	You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...	I have their past.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.	Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...	Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...	It was a veal stock, I thi...
It was a veal stock, I thi...	Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.	We have to talk.
We have to talk.	Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...	I didn't want to spoil our supper...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...	You'd rather spoil our walk home.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.	Yeh, it's cheaper.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.	So I'll have to order in?
So I'll have to order in?	We have the kids this weekend, so...
We have the kids this weekend, so...	Jesus.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.	For what?
For what?	Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...	I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --	You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.	Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.	I trust you of course I do but --
I trust you of course I do but --	But?  But what?
But?  But what?	But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.	I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
Look.  I know they hate me.	They don't hate you --
They don't hate you --	And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --	Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --	Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.	It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --	Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...	No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --	You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.	Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.

Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so...What do you think?
I think so...What do you think?	I think so too...
It's forever you know.	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?	Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.	Rache, it may take time.
Rache, it may take time.	What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...	It's no biggie.
It's just an assignment.	It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.	Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
They're my kids.	Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
No problem.	I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
What a great surpri...	Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.	Well, they will be.
Well, they will be.	Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
Why in the world would she t...	You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.	I needed some time away.
I needed some time away.	...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...	'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.	What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
I told her I loved her.	By way of saying you were unhappy.
By way of saying you were unhappy.	Restless.
Restless.	Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.	No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.	No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'	That's not us.
That's not us.	Because you've changed so much.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.	How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Where you goin'?	I'm gonna get me a drink.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.	Does Jackie know this?
Does Jackie know this?	No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.	In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?	Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...	Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.	Maybe he's gay.
Maybe he's gay.	Don't ever say that.
Don't ever say that.	What if he is?
What if he is?	He isn't.
Out! Leave the table!	What?
What?	You heard me: leave the table!
You heard me: leave the table!	Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.	Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?	Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hey.	Hey. What's up?
Hey. What's up?	There's something I need to talk about with you.
There's something I need to talk about with you.	What?
What?	There are some rumors...
There are some rumors...	Like what?
Like what?	You know...Stanley...
You know...Stanley...	Oh.
Oh.	And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
No prob. I'm cool.	Thanks, Scoob.
Marty, ignore him.	He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.	He was in a concentration camp?
He was in a concentration camp?	Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.	But I thought he came over to America before the war.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.	Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.	Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?	But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.

Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?	Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.	TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Consuelo?	Yes, Mikey?
Yes, Mikey?	Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?	Yes.
Yes.	Really? How many?
Really? How many?	Four brothers and five sisters.
Four brothers and five sisters.	Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?	It was God's will.

But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?	This is work.
This is work.	But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.

Who is Jesus?	My baby.
My baby.	You have a bay?
You have a bay?	My grandchild-baby.
My grandchild-baby.	Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?	He's dead.

I am sure.	But really, you never know.
But really, you never know.	I know!
I know!	Why was he on Death Row?
Why was he on Death Row?	For rape and murder.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?	It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.	Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
So whaddya think?	Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.	I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.

You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.	No, you don't.
No, you don't.	Yes, I do. I love them!
The camerawork's nice.	Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
This is definitely better.	You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?	This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.	Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.	I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.	No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?	You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?

Nothing, I guess	I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?	OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.	I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening	OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.	We're not ready.
We're not ready.	Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better	We're not ready!
We're not ready!	Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Well, I need to see this with an audience!	What's an audience going to tell you?
What's an audience going to tell you?	I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Don't even joke about that!	I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Twinkeys!	Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Mom?	Yes, Mikey?
Yes, Mikey?	I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?	What?
What?	550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.	Got a lot of homework?
Marty...	You started filling out your college applications yet?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?	Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
We used pull.	You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
It's all about who you know.	Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.	He's right.
Sure!...	Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Was anyone in my room today?	Is everything OK?
Is everything OK?	My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
What are you going to do?	I dunno.
We did the same thing last year also.	How was the class?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.	But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?	Fine.
Fine.	Ready for tomorrow?
Ready for tomorrow?	What's tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?	The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?	Huh?
Huh?	I can read it to you.
I can read it to you.	You mean, again?
You mean, again?	Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, I changed the ending a little.	Oh. What happens now?
Oh. What happens now?	Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.	Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.	But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.	I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?	You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You're tired of me. I can tell.	Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.	You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.	I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.	Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
What do you want?	Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Don't be so upset. It's OK...	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	You know he hated my story also.
You know he hated my story also.	Your story was terrible!
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!	Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!	That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.	Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.	I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.	You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?	Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.	Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Reconceive.	'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.	Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
But what kind of pull did you have?	I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.	...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Fuck!	I'm going in there.
I dunno.	Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
What DO you know?	Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
So? How was school today?	The same.
The same.	The same. Same as what?
The same. Same as what?	Just the same.
Get the hell outta here!	Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Scooby?	Yeah?
Yeah?	We have to talk.
Whaddya wanna talk about?	Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
OK.	Tired of this shit...
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.	Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.	Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?	One in a million recover.
One in a million recover.	Maybe he's that one in a million!
Maybe he's that one in a million!	Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.	Thanks.
Thanks.	You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?	Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.	OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.

Hi, Dad!	Come here, give me a hug!
Come here, give me a hug!	Gee, you're home early!
Gee, you're home early!	Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.	Sure, Dad.

Forget about it.	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...	You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What do you mean?	After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.	What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?	What do you think?
What do you think?	Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--	No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Cooper...	Yeah?...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.	What happened?
What happened?	By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.	Used to Filmore, used to.
Now what?	There's the fence...
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?	Because I'll be firing at them.
Because I'll be firing at them.	You're talking about committing suicide!
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!	Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Well Filmore--	Well Cooper...
Well Cooper...	Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...	I guess not Cooper...
I have a lighter!	Even better.
How well do you know this place?	We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--	Are the labs in operation?
Are the labs in operation?	I don't see why they wouldn't be.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.	Good...
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.
It's nothing to worry about.	We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
That's it!  Up ahead!	Where does it lead?
Where does it lead?	The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Enjoying the tour so far?	Are you going to kill us?
Are you going to kill us?	I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
Go fuck yourself...	Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...	You're going to pay for this...
You're going to pay for this...	You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?	It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...	Like where--in your dreams?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.	Yes, you should.
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--	Shut up!
Come on, drink up.	I don't want any...
I don't want any...	I insist...
I insist...	I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.	She's still alive.
She's still alive.	The transmission is an hour old...
Well?	We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.	Good.
Good.	We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!	Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
What about Cooper--where is he?	He's in there...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.	She's as good as gone...
She's as good as gone...	You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.	Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.	I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Who's Ryan Cooper?	I'll let the senator tell you.
And what exactly do they intend to do?	The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!	I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
So, what are we looking at White?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?	I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...	Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--	Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!	I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!	Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!	What the hell is it, anyhow?
What the hell is it, anyhow?	Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.	How much do they have?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...	What!
What!	They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
How goes the roll call?	We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.	I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.	I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.	Richter-we got a problem!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.	Excellent...excellent!
Where the hell could they have gone!	What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.	I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...	You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
What's happening at the waterfront?	We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.	Excellent.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?	Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.	Good.
Good.	I say we head out.
I say we head out.	Agreed--let's move it.
Agreed--let's move it.	Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.	Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!	Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?	Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--

Drop the anchor!	We can't--it's power driven!

Get your men to do it!	The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Just what the hell is he talking about?	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.

How much of this shit do they have, White!!	They must have got their hands on a test vial!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!	What does that mean?
What does that mean?	There's enough in one vial...
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.	You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!	All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?	Possibly some coffee?
Possibly some coffee?	Moffo!
Thank you, Admiral.	Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.	The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?	Don't be ridiculous.
Don't be ridiculous.	I have your word, Mister President?
I have your word, Mister President?	Yes, of course.
Where are you trying to reach him?	At his office in the Capitol.
At his office in the Capitol.	If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.	Did you get that, Kulnick?
What's the meaning of this?	I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.	I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.	Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.

In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.	Where is this...thing?
Where is this...thing?	It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?	First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.	That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!	The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.	The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Yes?	Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.	It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.	How dare you talk to me in this manner?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!	Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!	That's nonsense, and you know it!
That's nonsense, and you know it!	I know nothing of the sort!
I know nothing of the sort!	Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?	And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.	Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.	Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.	We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.	Oh, yes, that's right.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.	Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?	I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.	Give that back to me.
Give that back to me.	What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?	Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.	Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?	You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.	Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.	Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?	You mean you'll tell us his name???
You mean you'll tell us his name???	It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 	See!  See, I told you.
My seven body orifices????	That's right, fella.
That's right, fella.	One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.	Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...	Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?	I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.	What are you talking about, Major?
What are you talking about, Major?	The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.	Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Get a grip on yourself, Major!	It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Now, snap out of it, fella!	Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.	Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?	What?
What?	What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?	Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, I didn't shoot him!	We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?	Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.	Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.	Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?	Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.	Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.	You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!	Didn't they tell you?
Didn't they tell you?	They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.	Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.	Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 	Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.	On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.	Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?	You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.	Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!	What about the President?
What about the President?	He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?	So what?
So what?	Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.	That's government property, Major.
That's government property, Major.	Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.	What is your name, young lady?
What is your name, young lady?	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.	What did you say?
What did you say?	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.	Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
Yes!	General Schmuck?
General Schmuck?	Yes!  Who the hell is this?
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?	General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?	No, sir.
No, sir.	Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.	I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Does the threat board show anything?	Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Well, Mister President.	What kind of trouble?
What kind of trouble?	Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
General Schmuck?	Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???	To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.	You aren't sure!
You aren't sure!	Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.

Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.	Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?	Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!	I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.	Yes?
Yes?	Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.	I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.	Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.	That's a very wise deduction, General.
That's a very wise deduction, General.	Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?	Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.	You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.	But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.	What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?	That certainly would be a problem, sir.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.	I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.	Yes, sir.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.	This is General Ripper speaking.
This is General Ripper speaking.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Do you recognize my voice?
Do you recognize my voice?	Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Why do you think I ask?	I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.	Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?	No, sir.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.	Condition Red!
Condition Red!	That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.	Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!	A shooting war!
A shooting war!	Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.	But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?	Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.	Yes, sir.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.	That's right, sir.
That's right, sir.	We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?	You're right, sir.
You're right, sir.	No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.	I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.	No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.	Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?	Who do you think you're talking to?
Who do you think you're talking to?	To you, sir.  But how do I know?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?	Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?	No, sir.
No, sir.	I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.	Plan-R????
Plan-R????	Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Are you hard of hearing, Major?	No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.	As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.	General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.	Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?	No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.	You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.	Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.	Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?	Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.	Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?	That's right, Major.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?	Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.	I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.	Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?	Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.	Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?	That is correct, Major.
That is correct, Major.	And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?	You know the regulations well, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.	Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.	That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.	Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?	And if that were true?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?	Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
Suppose that were the case?	But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.	Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.	I know that, sir.
I know that, sir.	We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
I suppose they are, sir.	You're damned right they are.
You're damned right they are.	How much soda, sir.
How much soda, sir.	Just a squirt.
That about right?	Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?	Ask away, Major.
Ask away, Major.	Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?	I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.	No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.	Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?	I don't think so, sir.
I don't think so, sir.	He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.	I see.
I see.	When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?	I'm trying to, sir.
I'm trying to, sir.	You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.	But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?	If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?	Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?	That's close enough, Major.
That's close enough, Major.	But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?	You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.	Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?	I guess so.
I guess so.	I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.	But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.	You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.	But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.	Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?	Where, sir?
Where, sir?	Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.	Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.	And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.	You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?	Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.	But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.	I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.	But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?	Right.
Right.	Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?	Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
Go on, Major.	I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.	I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."	That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?	Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.	Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?	Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?	No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.	Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.	Major, you're talking like one of them!
Major, you're talking like one of them!	Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.	Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.	Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?	I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.	But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.	But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?	If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.	And you'd like to see that?
And you'd like to see that?	General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.	Do you think we'd cheat?
Do you think we'd cheat?	No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.	Do you think they would cheat?
Do you think they would cheat?	Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.

Major, those are my boys out there dying.	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.	Peace on earth.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.	Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
It was a honest mistake, sir.	I presume the planes are armed?
I presume the planes are armed?	I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.	Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?	That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.	And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?	Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?	What the hell is Plan-R?
What the hell is Plan-R?	Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.	Why can't you cancel it?
Why can't you cancel it?	Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.	And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.	Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?	We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.	How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?	Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.

We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.	Then there's no chance for recall?
Then there's no chance for recall?	I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.	I want to talk to General Ripper.
I want to talk to General Ripper.	But we can't communicate with the base.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.	Admiral Buldike?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 	That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
We don't operate like you KGB boys.	Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?	They're coming in now.
They're coming in now.	How long will it take to receive them all?
How long will it take to receive them all?	I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.	How many planes did we lose?
How many planes did we lose?	I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.	General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?	Naturally I am, sir.
Naturally I am, sir.	He says they've only shot down three planes.
He says they've only shot down three planes.	Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---	Look, he's there, and you're here.
Look, he's there, and you're here.	Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.	Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?	Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Yes?	Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.	Have you tried the recall again?
Have you tried the recall again?	Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.	What's the target.
What's the target.	Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?	If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.

General, stick to the point, please.	Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.	Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.	No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.	Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.	Roger. One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.	Lothar, take your checks now.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.	Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?	I don't think so.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.	Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.	You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.	Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
What else could it be?	Maybe it's an exercise.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.	They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!	He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.	The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Maximum ECM.	Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Then this is it.	What?
What?	War.
War.	War?
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.	Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.

Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.	Maximum ECM!
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.	We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.	Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!	Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?	Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.	Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.

They can't touch us at this height.	They're moving apart.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.	I think they mean business.
I think they mean business.	Hang on, boys.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.	Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.	Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.	Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.	Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.	Yeah?
Yeah?	I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.	Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.	That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.
No, this looks like the real thing.	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?	Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.	Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?	Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.	Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.	Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
So am I.	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.	Where'd they get you?
Where'd they get you?	Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
What does it look like?	Some kind of signaling.
Some kind of signaling.	No kidding.
No kidding.	Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.	Very interesting.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.	Forget it.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---	Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?	I've got one.
I've got one.	Shoot, Lothar.
Shoot, Lothar.	Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?	That's what I said.
That's what I said.	Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.	What's your point, Lothar?
What's your point, Lothar?	Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.	Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?	Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Check target approach.	Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.	Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.	When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?	As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Primary circuit is live.	Primary trigger switch.
Release first safety.	First safety.
Second safety.	Seond safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.	Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.	Master Kong.
Primary bomb is live.	All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.	Master safety on.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?	Everything still checks out okay.
Everything still checks out okay.	Binky?
Yes, Major.	Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.	Can't "Ace" help you?
Can't "Ace" help you?	He's dead.
He's dead.	What happened?
What happened?	I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???	Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
Where'd they get you?	In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
How do you know he's dead?	Hell, he looks dead.
He's dead, all right.	Listen, give me a shot quick!
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.	Quentin, how's your gear?
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."	Recall what mistake?
Recall what mistake?	No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	I mean pulling a stunt like that.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.	What are you talking about?
What do you mean?	Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.	Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?	You tell me.
You tell me.	They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.	Why should they call us back?
Why should they call us back?	How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?	Look, this is different.
Look, this is different.	Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.	But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.	Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Then that settles it, doesn't it?	Like hell it does.
Like hell it does.	The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?	Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?	That's the point.
That's the point.	I don't get you, King.
I don't get you, King.	I said that's the point!
I said that's the point!	Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.	Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???	Take it easy, Major Kong.
Take it easy, Major Kong.	Then get off my back!
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.	But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.	Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?	Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.	Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?	You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.	First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.	Sorry, King.
Sorry, King.	Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
Who's that?	It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?	I'm okay.  What's up?
I'm okay.  What's up?	Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.	Maybe the warning system's out.
Maybe the warning system's out.	But I get a red light.
But I get a red light.	Have you tried the emergency system?
Have you tried the emergency system?	I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?	But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.	I asked you a question, Lothar!
I asked you a question, Lothar!	But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?	Let me check.
Let me check.	There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.	Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?	Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.	Roger.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.	What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.	Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?	I thought maybe you'd like some company.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?	I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.	Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.	Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?	Forget it.
Forget it.	I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.	Sure, King.
Sure, King.	Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
At the bottom of mines?	Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.	But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!	Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.	But who would be chosen?
But who would be chosen?	A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.	But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?	Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.	Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?	I don't know.
We are?	Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Mn-hm.	"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Um-hm.	Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.	I don't anymore.
I don't anymore.	Can I have some?
Can I have some?	Knock yourself out.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?	Sure, all the time, in Group.
Sure, all the time, in Group.	In Group?
In Group?	Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.	Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.	Intense.
Intense.	How long were you in there?
How long were you in there?	Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.	Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?	No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.	I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.	Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.	It was pretty bad, huh?
It was pretty bad, huh?	It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.	Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.	Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.	Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.	You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.	Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.	You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
That was really great.	Was it okay?
Was it okay?	Yeah!
Yeah!	What did you guys think?
What did you guys think?	Slides go with it.
Slides go with it.	Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?	Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Uh-huh.	I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Responsibility, progress.	Yes.
Typical male.	Typical male.
Typical male.	Typical male.
Typical male.	Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Uh, home, you know.	Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.	You didn't get me in trouble.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?	No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?	Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey!	Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?	No I quit.
No I quit.	Hey, you said you did a video?
Hey, you said you did a video?	Yup.
Yup.	What's it about?
What's it about?	It's really not about anything.
It's really not about anything.	Oh. Well, what's it on?
Oh. Well, what's it on?	A cloud.
A cloud.	A cloud?
A cloud?	Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.	Oh.
Oh.	I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.	Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.	You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?	Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.	Your a nurse?
Your a nurse?	No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.	Any gunshot victims?
Any gunshot victims?	Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.	Sounds like a bummer.
Sounds like a bummer.	Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.	Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?	Right now?
Right now?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?	Do you wanna go to the van?
Do you wanna go to the van?	Now?
Now?	Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?	I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.	Okay, whatever you want.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.	Needs some pizza in his diet.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.	Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.	Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.	You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.	Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.	Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.	And your mom.
And your mom.	No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, I'm here. Where are you?	Where are you-hoo?
Where are you-hoo?	No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.	Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?	Shut up! Aw...
Stuck with what guy?	What?
What?	You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?	No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.	It's your birthday?
It's your birthday?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?	He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Pony's coming here to the corner?!	Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
I don't know. Later. I don't know.	Yes!
Don't let 'em fight.	The dude wants it.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.	That's the rock star thing.
That's the rock star thing.	No, no.
No, no.	Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!	Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.	Sorry.
Sorry.	Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.	You wanna bet he's with a girl?
You wanna bet he's with a girl?	No, he's not with a girl.
No, he's not with a girl.	Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!	You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.	Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?	I'd get bored.
I'd get bored.	I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.

That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?

Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?	Of course it does.

Alright, alright already.	Alright!
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"	That was so great!
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.	Mine too.

Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.	That's because I am.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.

"Don't write any checks you can't cash."	Really? What else does your mother say?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?	I think I gotta go.
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.	Where do you get your ideas?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"	So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.	"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Tim?	Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.

Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.	Oh, How'd she get back?
Oh, How'd she get back?	I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?

The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?	Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.	Whatever.
Whatever.	Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?	Don't do that, man, okay?

Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?	It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff	So where are you?
So where are you?	I'm here.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.	At least I have a point of view, you know?
Seriously? It's a great idea.	Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.	I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?	Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim.	No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.

Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.	Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.	Oh that's nice for you.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.	There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Could you give me a ride?	Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.	Tim, go throw up somewhere.

You know the fuck not.	Fuck.
Fuck.	Don't swear it's impolite.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!	Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
What?!	You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.	You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!	I just pulled and it - it came off.
I just pulled and it - it came off.	This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!	Look, it's really not my fault.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!	Sorry, Kansas...
Sorry, Kansas...	NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!	Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.	Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Holy shit.	You just became a statistic!
I'm in, too.	Cleo!
Cleo!	Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.	Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.	Conan went to Harvard.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!	It's twins!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!	Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Another sex dream?	Wayne Gretzky.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.	Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --	Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?	Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Di, we're sorry.  We...	It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?	Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.	My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?	I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Hello?	Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.	Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.	Bye.
Diane?  Diane!	Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!	No...I've been pregnant.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.	No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.	Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.	You sure?
You sure?	Positive.
Positive.	"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --	Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.	And they get caught!
And they get caught!	That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
No.	If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?	... I don't know.  Probably not.
... I don't know.  Probably not.	So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.	Well...
But, we have to make a smart plan!	Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.	Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.	That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"	She thinks you went to the police.
She thinks you went to the police.	WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?	I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, Jack.	Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?	I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.	Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?	Spit from your dad?
Spit from your dad?	I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.	Yeah.
Yeah.	So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.	Y'think?
Y'think?	I sure do.
I sure do.	Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.	Oh, Jack...
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.	But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.	Jack...
Jack...	If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?	Trix...
Trix...	Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
Jack, I think I should get a job.	But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...	I know, but that was before.
I know, but that was before.	Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!	Mmm-hmmm...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.	Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...	Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!	That was gas, Sweetie.
That was gas, Sweetie.	Oh... What are you working on?
Oh... What are you working on?	Jus some girlie things for the squad.
I'm sorry.	What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...	Let me explain something...
Let me explain something...	No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!	Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.	Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.	Well, I want to know what happened --
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.	I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
Madonna.	We're here for you, Diane.
Hat-trick?	He is the Great One...
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?	Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.	You sure I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...	Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.	And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Shut up.	Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Kansas!	I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...	Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!	Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...	We were told you could "fix us up."
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!	Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh no...	He Ikea'd us.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!	Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.	She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.	That you?
That you?	Yeah, hold on.
Yeah, hold on.	Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.	Don't use big bills!
Don't use big bills!	For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Yeah?	Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...	Hello?
Hello?	Kim-Lo?
Kim-Lo?	No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.	Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!	Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Yeah?	I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.	Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?	Ammo?
Ammo?	Bullets.
Bullets.	Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.	Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.	Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.	You're kidding.
You're kidding.	Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?	I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.	I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
You want us to help you pick up?	Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.	Or, I could get my own horse...
Or, I could get my own horse...	Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.	That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Hello?	We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.	Hannah, we've...
Hannah, we've...	It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!	Ooops, hold on a sec.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...	Hold on...
Screw Lucy!	Kansas?
Is that you down there?	Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.	Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?	Oh yeah, you caught us...
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.	Thanks!  That'd be great.
You got that big retarded girl down there?	Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.	Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?	I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.	You damn well better...
Really...	Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.	She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?	Definitely old.
Definitely old.	That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!	Maybe we can make a deal.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.	Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.	Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!	But you're not married.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...	Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!	I'm only allowed "G" movies.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.	Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
You sure you wanna go there?	Uh...maybe?
Uh...maybe?	'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.	Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
All of you!	Bank branch!
Bank branch!	All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.	Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.	I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.	They could kill you.
They could kill you.	So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...	I don't hate you.  I need your help.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.	My what?
My what?	Your help.
Your help.	Now how the hell can I help you?
Now how the hell can I help you?	Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.	Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?	My best friend got pregnant.
My best friend got pregnant.	Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.	Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...	I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.	So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.	Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?	What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!	Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.	Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.	More proof God's a guy...
More proof God's a guy...	...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!	Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.	Stop it!  This is crazy!
What the hell do you want?	I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.	I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?	I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...	Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?	I didn't mean to --
I didn't mean to --	Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.	I hear she was a terror to work with.
I hear she was a terror to work with.	She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.	You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.	Roll 'em.
Roll 'em.	Action! The scene starts.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !	Hi, Artie.
Hi, Artie.	Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?	In a deep freeze.
In a deep freeze.	I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Give me your coat.	Let it ride for a while.
Let it ride for a while.	You're going to stay, aren't you?
You're going to stay, aren't you?	That was the general idea.
That was the general idea.	Come on.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?	Close, but no cigar.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?	Where's the bar?
Good party.	The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.	Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Sure, this'll go on all night.	I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?	It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.	I'll take it.
I'll take it.	I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?	Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?	I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?	Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.	I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.	What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?	It's from hunger.
It's from hunger.	Nothing for Ladd?
Nothing for Ladd?	Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.	I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
This is Miss Kramer.	Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Name dropper.	I just think pictures should say a little something.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.	Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
If I could be of any help...	I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.	Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.	That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.	So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.	Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Hurt feelings department.	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
You forgot this.	Thanks.
Thanks.	I've been hoping to run into you.
I've been hoping to run into you.	What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?	I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.

Why, you sweet kid.	There's one called....Window... something with a window.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.	Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?	I didn't.
I didn't.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
Is there someplace we can talk?	How about the Rainbow Room?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.	The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.	I had a teacher like that once.
I had a teacher like that once.	Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...	Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Who wants true? Who wants moving?	Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.	Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.	I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.	I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?	As for instance?
As for instance?	Well....
Well....	We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?	How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?	Are you hungry?
Are you hungry?	Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --	Phillip, you're mad!
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.	O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.	You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.	You'll be waiting for me?
You'll be waiting for me?	With a wildly beating heart.
With a wildly beating heart.	Life can be beautiful!
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.	You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.	I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.	I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.	Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?	Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.	What teacher?
What teacher?	Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.	You did?
You did?	He thinks it could be made into something.
He thinks it could be made into something.	Into what? A lampshade?
Into what? A lampshade?	Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
O.K.  Where's the cash?	Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.	I was afraid of that.
I was afraid of that.	I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.	I tell you this is half sold.
I tell you this is half sold.	As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.	Sorry if I crossed you up.
Sorry if I crossed you up.	You sure have.
You sure have.	So long.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.	Well, for heaven's sake!
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.	Why should you do that?
Why should you do that?	If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.	You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.	What about all those ideas you had?
What about all those ideas you had?	See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.	Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.	This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.	Check.
Check.	Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...	I'll make it short.
I'll make it short.	Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.	I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.	I'm all tied up.  I can't.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.	Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.	What has Artie to do with it.
What has Artie to do with it.	We're engaged.
We're engaged.	Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.	I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.	It's just impossible.
It's just impossible.	Nobody can be that busy.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.	You're tough, all right.
You're tough, all right.	You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.	Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.	And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.

Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.	So do I.
So do I.	Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Oh, you --	And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Good.	What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.	I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.	It will?
It will?	Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.	Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?	Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Who's Norma?	Who's who?
Who's who?	I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.

So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.	I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.	When did he say it, Norma?
When did he say it, Norma?	So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
Have one of mine.	They're awful.  They make me cough.
They're awful.  They make me cough.	Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.	You're a darling.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	I ran into some people I knew.
I ran into some people I knew.	Where are my cigarettes?
Where are my cigarettes?	Where are your...?
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?	Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.	All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.	Maybe deMille is shooting.
Maybe deMille is shooting.	I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
Don't you want to come along, darling?	I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.	Thank you, darling.
How did it go?	It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
He must be quite a guy.	He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.	Yes, Norma.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.	Good night.
Good night.	I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.	Good.
Good.	I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.	Good.
Good.	You'd better get to bed yourself.
You'd better get to bed yourself.	I think I'll read a little.
I think I'll read a little.	You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?	I went for a walk.
I went for a walk.	No you didn't.  You took the car.
No you didn't.  You took the car.	All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?	Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.	I haven't done anything, Norma.
I haven't done anything, Norma.	Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?	Yes, I am, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.	No, you're not.  Max! Max!
No, you're not.  Max! Max!	Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.	It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.	And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.	These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?	Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.	You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.	That's between you and yourself, Norma.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.	You think I made that up about the gun...
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!	Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.	You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel	Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.
No, they don't.	What about the studio? What about De Mille?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?	He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.	Wanted what?
Wanted what?	De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.	That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!	You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.	That isn't true! Max?
You heard him.  I'm a star!	Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.	I'm the greatest star of them all.
I'm the greatest star of them all.	Goodbye.  Norma.
Goodbye.  Norma.	No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --	Go on in.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --	Wipe your feet!
You are not dressed properly.	Dressed for what?
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.
Madame is waiting.	For me?  Okay.
I made your bed this afternoon.	Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
This room has not been used for a long time.	It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.	Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.	She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.

I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.	Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.	Is that so!
Is that so!	Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?	Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
I'm not here.	That's what I told them.
That's what I told them.	Good.
Good.	They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
Whose room was this?	It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.	There are no locks anywhere in this house.
How come?	The doctor suggested it.
The doctor suggested it.	What doctor?
What doctor?	Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.	Uh-huh?
Uh-huh?	We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.	Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.	I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.	You send them.  Is that it, Max?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?	I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.	No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?	I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
How is she?	She is upstairs.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.	Right with you.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.	That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.	He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
What's the matter, Max?	I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.	What?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?	You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.	How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?	I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...	Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.	It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.	Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?	She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.	You made her a star?
You made her a star?	I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.

And she's turned you into a servant.	It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
Joseph C. Gillis?	That's right.
We've come for the car.	What car?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.	Is that So?
Is that So?	I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.	Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.	You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.	Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.	You say the cutest things.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?	It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.	So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?	More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Got a title?	Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.	Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.	No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.	Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.	Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?	Frankly, no.
Frankly, no.	Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.	You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.	Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -	Along is no good.  I need it now.
Along is no good.  I need it now.	Haven't got a thing.
Haven't got a thing.	Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.	There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.	Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?	Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -

So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.	No?
No?	Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
How's that about your being my friend?	Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.	Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.

What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.	Maybe what you need is another agent.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?	Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.	Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?

Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?	Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.	Yes, Madame.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.	You know better than to interrupt me.
You know better than to interrupt me.	Paramount is calling.
Paramount is calling.	Who?
Who?	Paramount studios.
Paramount studios.	Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.	It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.	Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!	I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.	Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.	Very good, Madam.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.	Thank you, Max.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?	The cameras have arrived, Madame.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.	They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
What is the scene? Where am I?	This is the staircase of the palace.
This is the staircase of the palace.	Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.	All right.  Camera!  Action!
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.	But where?
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.	It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.	How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.	But what will happen?
But what will happen?	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.	What is it?
What is it?	The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
What does it mean?	The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?	Softball.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.	But which one?
But which one?	Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.	And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?	Sorry, mistress.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?	He will be. In about five minutes.
He will be. In about five minutes.	Have fun.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?	It's what we were warned about.
A Storm Dragon?	No, a super girl.
Why did she have to show up now?	Eliminate her.
Eliminate her.	That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.	You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.	Am I? Still?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.	I've been saving it. For the right moment.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.	That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.	The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.	Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.
Whatever you say.	Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Home?	No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.	Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.	Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
I don't feel like it right now.	She didn't take it from you, did she?
She didn't take it from you, did she?	That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.	There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
At last. Ultimate Power.	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!	What do you mean we?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.	What do you want?
What do you want?	Western Europe.
Western Europe.	I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.	No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Is this Nigel's doing?	It's a warning, that's for sure.
It's a warning, that's for sure.	Maybe it was just an accident.
Maybe it was just an accident.	There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Wait...don't leave me in here...	It's for your own protection.
What's happening?	I'm taking you to the hospital.
I'm taking you to the hospital.	Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.	Later.
Don't leave me.	I have to.
I have to.	When can I see, you again ?
When can I see, you again ?	Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!	Who didn't?
Who didn't?	That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.	You love me?
You love me?	My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...	We have to have a long talk about all this.
We have to have a long talk about all this.	I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
This is my favourite place in the city.	Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?	They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Like it?	Yes. It reminds me of home.
Yes. It reminds me of home.	Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Where Superman's from? Krypton?	No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.	I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.	It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.	Come on, let's ride.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.	Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.	Let's talk about us, not her.
Let's talk about us, not her.	Tell me where I can find her.
Tell me where I can find her.	I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.	We can't do that.
We can't do that.	Why not ?
Why not ?	We're from different worlds.
We're from different worlds.	Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.	What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.	What's that?
What's that?	Let me kiss you.
Let me kiss you.	No.
No.	You're not afraid are you?
You're not afraid are you?	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.	If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.	Well...I guess one is all right.
Is this how?	Terrific.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.	But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.	You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---	Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
She said it wouldn't last.	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?
Just like that?	Like turning off a light.
Away. From you.	But why?
But why?	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.	I sort of like what you said.
I sort of like what you said.	That makes it worse.
That makes it worse.	But I don't understand.
Hi.	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?	I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at you.	It seemed that way to me.
It seemed that way to me.	I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.	Miss what?
Miss what?	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
And now?	And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
You think so?	I don't see why not.
I don't see why not.	But what if---it wasn't real?
But what if---it wasn't real?	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?	Are you asking me for a "date"?
Are you asking me for a "date"?	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?	She'll forget about us eventually.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?	In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.	I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Wait. Don't leave me.	You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Before you go...	What?
What?	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?	Yes.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.	She has hostages.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!	How do I fight it?
How do I fight it?	Turn it against her.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.	I'll come back as soon as I can.
She's right. They'll string her up.	Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hey! Ethan!	Hmmm?
Hmmm?	Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
A little.	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.	I'll mention it upstairs.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.	I did.
I did.	Well thanks a pile, fella.
Finished your estimate?	Well, there's several ways to go .
Well, there's several ways to go .	Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.	I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.	I bet they do.
I bet they do.	What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.	Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
What is it?	A passionfruit smoothee.
A passionfruit smoothee.	Well, just one.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.	I'll drink to that.
Oh no, not you again.	What an adorable hat.
What an adorable hat.	They think I have a concussion.
They think I have a concussion.	And you think you're in love.
And you think you're in love.	I know it.
I know it.	This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.	Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe you?	It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.	Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Nurse! Nurse!	You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.	Nurse!
Nurse!	Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.	Nurse! Help !
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.	I don't want your help.
I don't want your help.	Come back to my house. My car's outside.
No!	I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.	I could force you.
I could force you.	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.	Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.	You vicious--
You vicious--	Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?	Yeah.
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.
I don't know. You seem afraid.	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?	Supergirl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?	Well...I guess I can't.
Well...I guess I can't.	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Why the empty cage?	That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.	Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.	Why George, are you proposing?
Why George, are you proposing?	Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...	George---I thought you'd never ask.
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
I've got things to do.	What about my proposal?
What about my proposal?	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.	Nice to meet you.
Do you have any theories about last night?	Theories?
Theories?	How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.	Can I quote you?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.	I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?	Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.
Oh, no thanks.	It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Someone's chasing him.	Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?	Yes.
Yes.	The scoop of the year!
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?	-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?	Oh, sure.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!	How do you know?
How do you know?	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.	Did anybody notice you?
Did anybody notice you?	I can't help it if men notice me.
I can't help it if men notice me.	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.	I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.	Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.	You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?	You bet your ass.
You bet your ass.	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	You're supposed to guess.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.	But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.	It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.	Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.	I allowed it to escape the City.
Superman will return it.	Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.	As brave as my father. As wise.
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
What's a tree?	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.	Where is Earth?
Where is Earth?	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?	Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.	I don't understand.
I don't understand.	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I can do that.	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
There isn't any.	This is all your clothes?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?	I'd rather not talk about it.
I'd rather not talk about it.	You're not...an orphan are you?
You're not...an orphan are you?	My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.	Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.	Thank you. You're very kind.
She did that deliberately.	She's a beast.
How'd you do that?	Must've been a defective puck.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.	But what for?
But what for?	She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Your hair looks the same.	It was just a trim.
No thanks. You go on.	You sure?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...	Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.	Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.	It doesn't seem right.
It doesn't seem right.	Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
Why is he acting so strangely?	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Lucy; come back!	Somebody's gotta do something!!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.	Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.	He's nice.
He's nice.	Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?	I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.	Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
Don't you believe in knocking?	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
What can I do for you?	I'm Linda Lee.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.	Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?	No, MR. Danvers.
No, MR. Danvers.	Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?	I'd love to.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.	What? Me?
What? Me?	Sure. Mate in five moves.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.	I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I just did. Because I have the Power.	You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.	Cigarette?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.	You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.	I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Balefire on you, Selena!	You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.	Throw him out.
Nigel, get lost.	I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you.	You're wasting your breath.
You're wasting your breath.	You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.	I could teach you a thing or two now.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?	I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.	Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?	You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.	Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.	Nonsense.
That was meant for me!	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Who are you ?	I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.	I don't scare that easily.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.	A cheap trick.
A cheap trick.	Cheap but effective.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.	It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.	Not yet.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.	For what?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
What's it like?	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Where is inner space?	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.	That's home.
What is this place?	This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?	I was on Earth...
I was on Earth...	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?	Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Shouldnt've done that.	...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.	It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---	I know.
I know.	Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
Others?	Criminals.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."	What? Palace? Hardly.
What? Palace? Hardly.	Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
It's lovely. . .	No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.	Are you happy, Zaltar?
Are you happy, Zaltar?	What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.	But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
You look at them? How?	The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
That horrible woman!	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Zaltar, please help me.	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Of course, my dear. What can I do?	Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.	No, that's not true---there's well...no--
There is a way.	I knew it!
I knew it!	But it's impossible.
But it's impossible.	Why?
Why?	No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Then teach me how.	No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.	Then come with me.
Then come with me.	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?	You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?	Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.	Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
You can use the wand.	Better than when I was a child.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.
Don't stop. Keep moving.	Yes, mustn't stop.
Yes, mustn't stop.	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar. Use the wand!	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Goodbye...	Zaltar!
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
What?	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What are you talkin' about?	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.	Mr. Roebush?
Mr. Roebush?	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?	Tuesday.
Tuesday.	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?	Not enough vodka in it.
Not enough vodka in it.	There's no vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Aha! What'd I tell ya!	What? What did you tell me?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?	Brad.
Brad.	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?	Brad?
Brad?	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never. 
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --	Brad Wilson.
Brad Wilson.	Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?	I seem to be.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.	The kid needs a man to show him --
The kid needs a man to show him --	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Lana Lang. How great to see you.	Clark.
You look wonderful.	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.	You're welcome...??
You're welcome...??	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?	It sure is.
It sure is.	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
You know what's the problem?	Too much mayonnaise?
Too much mayonnaise?	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?	I didn't --
I didn't --	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.	But Lana, you could --
But Lana, you could --	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?	Who?
Who?	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
You...um...you never got married?	Oh...I came close once.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?	You thought that?
You thought that?	I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
I just can't stand this.	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.	But all he had was chocolate milk.
But all he had was chocolate milk.	I mean him.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.	Some people don't think it's healthy.
Some people don't think it's healthy.	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.	Me??
Me??	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.	There's a lot of choices here.
There's a lot of choices here.	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Peanut butter and jelly.	No, thanks.
No, thanks.	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.	Me neither...
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
I can never get a way from it.	Old ties are hard to cut.
Old ties are hard to cut.	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?	Call me.
Call me.	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.	Can I help?
He really was!	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	Well, aren't you excited?
Well, aren't you excited?	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --	Anyday...
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.	Oh. You're going away.
Uh...excuse me, folks...	Kent!
Kent!	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Well...  Not quite like this.	Mom and I do this all the time.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!	What!
Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?	Sure.
Sure.	Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?	Say!
Say!	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
You're the best, Lois.	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.

I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.	Oh?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?	Mmmmm . . .
Mmmmm . . .	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --	What's that?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!	At one o'clock in the morning?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?	What are you doing?
What are you doing?	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.

First paycheck?	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.

Gus?	Say what?
Say what?	The boss wants to see you.
The boss wants to see you.	Say who?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?	Uh...
Uh...	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...	Or socks.
Or socks.	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?	I'm tryin' to.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!	Black or regular?
Black or regular?	I don't think you understand.
Man, what is this?	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!	Decaffeinated too?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?	Which country?
Which country?	Columbia.
Columbia.	Columbia.
Columbia.	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
Wipe 'em out?	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?	A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.	Me? How?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?	That what they call you?
How do you do that?	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.	When?
When?	First question got to be "Where."
First question got to be "Where."	What?
What?	Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!
Just the man I wanted to see!	Turn on the T.V.
Turn on the T.V.	I did. isn't it neat-o?
I did. isn't it neat-o?	Uh...what channel were you watching?
Uh...what channel were you watching?	What are you talking about, fella?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'	God, that's what I keep you for.
God, that's what I keep you for.	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.	Greed!  Let me tell you something---
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...	KRYPTONITE!
KRYPTONITE!	Huh?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.	They ain't got captains?
They ain't got captains?	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
And then shut down the pipe lines.	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Now...when do I get a taste?	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Is this blackmail?	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.	Is this whitemail?
Is this whitemail?	Fair's fair.
Fair's fair.	What do you want?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.	For what?
For what?	A computer.
A computer.	We've already got some.
We've already got some.	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.	You designed it?
You designed it?	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.	What will it do?
What will it do?	Everything.
Everything.	What will it get me?
What will it get me?	Anything.
Anything.	Tell me more...
Yeah? How's it look?	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.	I told you it wasn't no jive.
I told you it wasn't no jive.	Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.	Stone mutha.
Stone mutha.	Exactly. Stoned mother.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!	Can you do that?
Can you do that?	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
You want to mess with Superman?	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!	Join the party, genius! Come on up!
How you doing down there?	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.	Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.	Watch out for them air pockets!
Watch out for them air pockets!	No, we're just going down.
No, we're just going down.	We gonna crash?
We gonna crash?	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.	We back in Metropolis?
We back in Metropolis?	No...I just have a little stop to make.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.	Just a second.
Thanks.  Let's go	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...	Sister! I'm his sister!
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.	What she call you?
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.	And do what?
I know, by computers.	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Who is she?	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Who's the other woman?	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!	I didn't have my camera with me.
I didn't have my camera with me.	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.	What about me?
What about me?	What about you?
What about you?	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Why do I have to do this?	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.	It was hot!
Ricky?  Where...what...	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.	Thank ...you.
Thank ...you.	Anytime.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.	We've already met.
We've already met.	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.	You just did, with that great dinner.
There's no rush.	But the bridge...
But the bridge...	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
The picture looks blurry.	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
What terrific story?	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.	Whoopee.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
I thought you'd never get here.	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Lots of things...	Tell me.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
I don't know you, lady.	But the other night...
But the other night...	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?	Diet soda?
Diet soda?	Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
How would you know?	Hey, I know a lot of things!
Hey, I know a lot of things!	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.
Turn on the light.	Where's the light switch?
Where's the light switch?	Where do you usually find a light switch?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.	Gus?
Gus?	Superman. The boy you left behind.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:	In other words, push this red button.
Oh, Superman!	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!	He can have mine. Anytime.
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
53.	53!
Okay? Goodbye.	You've got to pick three more numbers.
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.	Why do I have to do this?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.	Where's the handle?
Where's the handle?	There is no handle! You just push a button.
85,000 dollars.	Missing????
Missing????	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?	Hello.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.	It could make weather!
It could make weather!	Storms! Floods!
Storms! Floods!	Blizzards! Heat waves!
Computers talk to other computers, right?	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
She's not his mama either.	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!	Today coffee----
Today coffee----	TOMORROW THE OIL!
Small potatoes.	We already have a super-tanker.
We already have a super-tanker.	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.	Don't cry, Bubba.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...	What's wrong?
What's wrong?	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.	Where did it come from?
Where did it come from?	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
So?	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...	A normal person.
A normal person.	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...	We can get to work on that oil!
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.	Who needs Gus?
He's the only one who can operate this --	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!
Yes! This time we got it right!	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
Anybody been hurt?	So far the hostages are unharmed.
So far the hostages are unharmed.	Hostages?
Hostages?	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Are you okay?	She'll be fine.
Lois, I usually do.	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Lois, what are you doing?	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?	Uh. . .
Uh. . .	Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.	One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.	Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
I don't?	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.	I do?
I do?	Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?	Actually, yes.
Actually, yes.	Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?	Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --	Maybe I could try --
Maybe I could try --	Be my guest.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?	Really?
Really?	Of course, that's what friends are for.
It is kinda romantic.	In July???
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.	But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
A "complimentary corsage."	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.	Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.	Lois, you're amazing.
Lois, you're amazing.	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?	Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?	I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.	Superman? Oh, was he here?
Superman? Oh, was he here?	And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Who ????	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --	No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?	How could you win a crazy bet like --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.	What??
Oh Clark, no!	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
It's true. It's true.	Lois, I . . .
Lois, I . . .	I was right. you are Superman.
I was right. you are Superman.	Oh come on, that's ridic -
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .	Maybe you wanted to.
Maybe you wanted to.	I didn't think I wanted to.
I didn't think I wanted to.	Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.
We'd better talk.	I'm listening.
I'm listening.	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.	"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
I want to.	Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.	Say you love me.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .	Let's get you inside . . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.	I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .	But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .	I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Hi.	Oh, hi.
Sleep well?	Never closed my eyes.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "

You're not selfish at all.	Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
"They?"	Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.	What else could I do?
What else could I do?	Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?	Lois, someday --
Lois, someday --	Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.	I like worrying about you.

Take it easy. Take a deep breath.	I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
. . . Superman?. . . . .	Lois, I really don't see why --
Lois, I really don't see why --	Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
I'll try to remember that . . .	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.	You do?
You do?	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Everything on it?	Everything on it.
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?	Uh...home...
Uh...home...	Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?	Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --

Does Lois know about this yet?	Does she know about it? She's in it!
Does she know about it? She's in it!	What??
What??	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Gee. But --	No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.	No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.

You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.	Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --	Yes, but it's not all I feel.

Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...	We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.	Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.	The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.	Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
He flies as well, then . . .	Constantly.
Constantly.	He has powers as we do . . .
He has powers as we do . . .	Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.	We will bring him to his knees!
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .	What do you want?
What do you want?	Australia.
Superman! The --	Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --	The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
You must be freezing.	I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.	Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
So --  I hope you like it.	Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.	Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.	Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.	Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.	But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.	Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.	I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!	Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .	Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .	Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .	Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.	Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.	He ran in fear from us . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?	Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.	Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .	What more?
What more?	Cuba.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.	Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?	North. Keep going North!
Put down Lex Luthor !	Put down Lex Luthor?
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --	Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.	It will. Starting with your own.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?	I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.	Zod.  Zod.
Who is this . . . Superman?	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .	Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?	In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.	There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.

Yes, but will you honor it?	We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Free!	Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..	Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!	DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .

So this is the planet Houston . . .	What shall we do now?
What shall we do now?	Stay. I will come to you.
Look, they need a machine to fly.	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
You are master of all you survey.	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.	Yes?
Yes?	He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .	Sentimental idiot.
He's captured Non!	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
General --- ?	We must combine our strength.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?	"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'	I really don't think . . .
I really don't think . . .	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
They make my eyes itch.	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
You're late. Very late.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
I've never been in a place like this before.	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.	What about here?
What about here?	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .	Don't worry, I've got you.
Maybe I should sit this one out.	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.	If you say so. Here goes.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Gee, I don't think . . .	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.	. . . Let me get my purse.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Oh . . . my . . .	Clark. . . !
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Gee, I'm really sorry.	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.	I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm sorry to see you go.	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.	I'm not so sure you do.
I'm not so sure you do.	Any more like you back home, Clark?
Any more like you back home, Clark?	Like me?
Like me?	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.	Lacy. . . I . . .
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
No Paris?	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.	Clark . . . wait!
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.	Politely?
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Superman? Has something happened to him?	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.	But Superman isn't an average man.
But Superman isn't an average man.	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
And what do we get out of it?	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Impossible? Why?	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Well, I don't understand.	I'm sorry.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?	Absolutely!
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?	N-no...I mean...you bet.
Awesome!	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.	I'll try. . .
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .	Go on . . .
Go on . . .	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.	Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .	Daddy . . . ?
Daddy . . . ?	Yes, darling?
Yes, darling?	Stuff it.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Is he for real?	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
I think he's kind of cute.	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.	. . . And  very nave!
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.	Superman gets mail here?
I think there's an angle.	An angle?
An angle?	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.	Who?
Who?	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .	But he's never there.
But he's never there.	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
What's he going to say?	Something . . . wonderful.
What's that?	Our other dinner guest.
Where's Clark?	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.	It always is with Clark.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!	A toupee that flies?
A toupee that flies?	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.	But why the hair?
But why the hair?	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Whoa. . .	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.	Get the box, nephew.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?	Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .	The one Superman wrecked up?
The one Superman wrecked up?	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.	There!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Hey! Just remember I made you.	You're just an experiment, freako!
What was that about?	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
He's . . . cold. . .	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.	What?
Boy, are you gonna get it.	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
We'll all fry.	This wasn't in the plan.
This wasn't in the plan.	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.	Ready, Uncle Lex?
Ready, Uncle Lex?	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
You think he'll find us.	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.	Lucky I brought my drums.
What I need this for?	For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...	You are . . .
You are . . .	What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?	You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I am an experiment? I am freako?	I made you, and I can destroy you.
Destroy Superman!	Wait! Not yet! Back!
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.	First, I have fun.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?	What do you fear?
What do you fear?	Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?	Destiny.
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!	I am master now.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.	Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.	Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?	Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .

It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?	Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?	You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.	No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
I'm not going anywhere.	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.	Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.	You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.	A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
I'll deal with you later.	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
But . . . how could you beat him?	High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?	No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
I know, but  --	Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!	Bunkers!
Bunkers!	I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?	Nobody else.
Nobody else.	Shut up, apple-polisher.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?	He's thirty-five years old.
He's thirty-five years old.	You're a great architect, Albert.
You're a great architect, Albert.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!	We're running out of smoke.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --	Albert!
Albert!	--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.	One of them should've been you.
One of them should've been you.	Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!	Got it? Otis?
Me?	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.	I've been on the job.
I've been on the job.	A hot story, huh?
A hot story, huh?	It was hot, yes.
It was hot, yes.	You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.	Lois isn't here?
Lois isn't here?	She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.	What's she doing in California?
What's she doing in California?	It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?	No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.	I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Don't worry, Mom. I know.	Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Mom...	I know.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.	He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Mother...	I know son, I know...
Do you know where you're headed?	North. It's north
Keep warm now.	I will.
I'd like to.	Well!
I'll bet you have some good ideas.	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Your bookie?	No.
No.	I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.	Actually, she's silver-haired.
Actually, she's silver-haired.	Not...gray.

See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?	Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.	Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
Hey!	What the  --  !
Stop him, Clark!	He may have a gun!
He may have a gun!	Oh, for God's sake!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.	You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
Know what?	You described the exact contents of my purse.
You described the exact contents of my purse.	I just took a shot at it.
What now, my love?	Huh?
Huh?	Big night coming up?
Big night coming up?	Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?	Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.	Oh.

It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.	Don't you ever give up?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.	There's no real proof that tobacco  --
There's no real proof that tobacco  --	Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.

Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'	My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land!

What's the temperature now?	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.	When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton!	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.	I read the article.
I read the article.	Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.

Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.	I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
You're happy, aren't you?	La de da da...
La de da da...	You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...	We just take it?
We just take it?	What do you suggest, my dear?
What do you suggest, my dear?	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?

Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.	I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?	He is. Usually.
He is. Usually.	Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???	You've got me? Who's got you???
You've got me? Who's got you???	Do as I say. Let go!
Do as I say. Let go!	Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Who...who...	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
With my luck, now it'll rain.	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Superman???	Right on the first guess.
Right on the first guess.	Wha'...what are you doing here?
Wha'...what are you doing here?	I came to talk to you.
I came to talk to you.	The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?	There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.	This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?	Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Well...flashlight?	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.	If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?	Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.	Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?	Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.	Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.	You think they're strange?
You think they're strange?	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.	I guess they are a little odd.
I guess they are a little odd.	Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.	Oh.
Oh.	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.	It must feel great.
It must feel great.	It's not bad.
It's not bad.	How old are you?
How old are you?	Thirty-five.
Thirty-five.	How much do you weigh?
How much do you weigh?	195 pounds.
195 pounds.	What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?	What about it?
What about it?	Can you really see through anything?
Can you really see through anything?	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.	Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do bullets really bounce off you?	Only when somebody shoots them at me.
What color underwear am I wearing?	Pink.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?	Sure.
Sure.	Do you like pink?
Do you like pink?	Very much.
Very much.	Where do you hail from?
Where do you hail from?	Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
I...uh...	No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?	Yessir. Just what you wanted.
There.	Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!	Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?	Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
What's the matter, Otis?	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.	Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I broke the man out of prison --	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.	I gave him steady employment --
I gave him steady employment --	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.	I gave him this new face.
I gave him this new face.	I...uh...check.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?	I guess I...uh...regressed.
Please...	Otis...
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.
It is for me.	Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --	Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.	It's a Twinkie, boss.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.	Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.	Oh, Mr. Luthor...
I still don't get it.	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Sort of.	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
What is this??!	Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?	But...why?
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?	Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?	Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.	I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.	No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --	Of time, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.	Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.	Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.	Maybe I should get help.
Maybe I should get help.	It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --	You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.	The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...	On radio waves?
On radio waves?	And garbage doors.
Luthor  --	You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...	They'll soon be over.
They'll soon be over.	In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.	For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!	We'll see how fast I can fly.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.	Alison Jones.
Yes.	Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That was my nickname.	Ally.  That's right.
Ally.  That's right.	How are you?
How are you?	I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?	I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.	And what does he do again?
And what does he do again?	He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Ally Jones.	How is Mrs. Stephens?
How is Mrs. Stephens?	We're...not together.
We're...not together.	I'd heard that.  But she's well?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?	Yes...fine.
Yes...fine.	And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.	Are you still in touch?
Are you still in touch?	Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.	Which one?
Which one?	Which one?
Which one?	Which clinic?
Which clinic?	I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.	Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
So there were others?	Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...	Then...when did she get better?
Then...when did she get better?	She didn't.
She didn't.	But you said...
But you said...	That's where I'm going.  To see her.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.	She's in trouble?
She's in trouble?	Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
What...does it turn to?	It turns to steaming piss.
I'm...so sorry.	That's okay.
I...don't think so.	I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.	What happened?
What happened?	I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
What happened?	Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.	Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.	Alison.
Alison.	Alison.
Alison.	Say hi to Zoe.
Say hi to Zoe.	I will.
I will.	I hope she gets better.
I hope she gets better.	I'll tell her that.
My name is...	Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.	I understand.
I understand.	No you don't.
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.	No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.	Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.	You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.	Case?
Case?	The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.

And the Ottos wouldn't deal
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.	Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?	I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.	Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?	I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Hi, Nicole.	Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...	They just finished supper.
They just finished supper.	Was it good?
I'll be back around nine.	Okay.
Are you sure?	Yeah.
Yeah.	It just seems...kind of weird.
It just seems...kind of weird.	Why?
Why?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.	No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.	And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?	I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.	Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.	Goodnight, Nicole.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.	Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.	Billy, please.  The children.
Billy, please.  The children.	The children.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?	She's resting.  In her room.
She's resting.  In her room.	Say hello for me.
So what brings you out tonight?	Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.	It does concern me.
It does concern me.	Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.	How?
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.	Why not?
Why not?	Because it's what we have to do.
Because it's what we have to do.	Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.	Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.	So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.	But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.	That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.

I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.	That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...	C'mon, you know that won't...
C'mon, you know that won't...	We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.	Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.	It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.	I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.	I'm sorry.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.	Billy, that's too early.
Billy, that's too early.	She said she's got to be home by nine.
She said she's got to be home by nine.	Can't you make it later?
Have you been waiting long?	A while.
A while.	Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?	No.  It should be dry by now.
What time's he coming home?	When the game's over, I guess.
What are you thinking?	Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.	That's because he misses you.
Yes.	It's natural.
It's natural.	Your kids never cry.
Your kids never cry.	Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.	They can look forward to that.
They can look forward to that.	Sure.
Sure.	Just like we look forward to this.
You're leaving.	I better get back.
Good night, Billy.	Good night.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?	Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...	Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.	...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.	You believe that?
You believe that?	I have to.
I have to.	Why?
Why?	Because I have to.
Because I have to.	Well I don't.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?	Yes.
Yes.	Why did you do that, Billy?
Why did you do that, Billy?	You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.	What do you mean by that, Dolores?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?	About the Ottos?
About the Ottos?	Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...	Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?	No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.	And they loved Bear.
And they loved Bear.	Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.	For rabbits?
For rabbits?	
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.	From what?
From what?	From what?
From what?	Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...	No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.	You talked about it?
You talked about it?	No.  I saw it on his face.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.	Berries.
Berries.	Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.	Berry-picking.
Berry-picking.	Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.	And what's that?
And what's that?	With our hands.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.	Were his parents...attentive to him?
Were his parents...attentive to him?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.	That's right.
That's right.	Did his parents attend to that?
Did his parents attend to that?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Did they give him special care?
Did they give him special care?	The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.	What's that, Dolores?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?	That would complicate things.
That would complicate things.	Because I'd be to blame, right?
Because I'd be to blame, right?	Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.	He knows that?  Billy?
He knows that?  Billy?	Yes.  He does.
Yes.  He does.	Billy said that?
You've talked to Billy?	I did.
I did.	And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...	Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.	What other people?
What other people?	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
You heard what Abbott said?	Yes.
Yes.	Anything you didn't understand?
Anything you didn't understand?	There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
That's what he said, is it?	Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.	Why would he be frightened?
Why would he be frightened?	I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.	Hi, Dolores.
What do you think?	Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.	You hate it.
You hate it.	I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.	I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.	I'll just strap it on the roof.
It's for the school bazaar.	Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.	Away from your crazy Mom.
Away from your crazy Mom.	The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
You want a cup of tea or something?	A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...	How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.	No.  A little sugar though.
No.  A little sugar though.	We've only got honey.
We've only got honey.	I'll...take it straight.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.	Isn't it a lovely day?
Isn't it a lovely day?	What happened to summer?
What happened to summer?	Summer's over.  It's fall.
Summer's over.  It's fall.	And winter?
And winter?	Well, winter's far behind us now.
How was it?	We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
So do you like your new room?	It's interesting.
It's interesting.	Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.	I feel like a princess.
Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.
Yes.  It's a present.	From you?
From you?	No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.	Who's Mr. Stephens?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?	No.  What's this lawyer business?
Nicole!	It's the truth.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.	Did he say what about?
Did he say what about?	No.
No.	Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?	Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?	That's what he said.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.	Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...	What's a ditty again?
What's a ditty again?	It's like a song.
It's like a song.	Oh.
What's vermin again?	Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...

Nicole?
Nicole?	Yes.
Yes.	Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?	Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?	I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.	Okay.
Nicole?	What, Mason?
That's right.	Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?	Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.	The people in the town?
The people in the town?	Yes.
Yes.	So he was mean?
So he was mean?	No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.	Oh.
Oh.	Should I keep reading?
Should I keep reading?	Okay.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...	You hate that.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.	That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?	Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.	What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.	I won't lie.
I won't lie.	I don't want you to lie.
I don't want you to lie.	The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.	There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.	You seem very sure about that.
You seem very sure about that.	I'm absolutely positive.
Dolores.	Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.	Why?
Why?	So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
It was snowing.	Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.	Was the bus on time?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?	I object to that form of question. Note that.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'	Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.	And what was the weather like at this time?
I have no questions.	Thank you, Nicole.
Do you have a room?	Will you be spending more than a night?
Will you be spending more than a night?	Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
What about Doreen?	She...she was a friend of mine.
She...she was a friend of mine.	When?
When?	At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...	That's the local bar?
That's the local bar?	...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.	There's the Prescots...
Tell me about the Ottos.	Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.	Indian?
Yes.	That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.	What do they do?
What do they do?	Crafts.
Crafts.	Crafts?
Crafts?	Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Have they ever been busted?	No.
Need a hand?	Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
You always think you're prepared for these things.	Tell me about it.
Tell me about it.	How old is she?
How old is she?	Almost three.
Almost three.	Is this it?
Is this it?	Perfect.
Perfect.	Here we go.
Here we go.	Thanks.
I'm in a car wash.	A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.	Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?

Why are you calling me, Zoe?	Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.	So what's the problem?
So what's the problem?	The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.	'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
DADDY!!!	Yes.
Why can't you talk to me?	I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Yes, I'll accept the charges.	Daddy?
Daddy?	Yes.
Yes.	I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.	News?
News?	Don't you want to hear?
Don't you want to hear?	Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.	You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.	Tell me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.	Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.	That's not news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.	No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?	Yes.
Yes.	I tested positive.
I tested positive.	Yes.
Yes.	Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.	I need money.
I need money.	What for?
What for?	You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.	Do you have the blood test?
Do you have the blood test?	You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?	Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.	Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Oh God, I'm scared.	I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Some more wine?	I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.	I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?	What is it?
What is it?	Poached salmon.
We do.	Is there shrimp on it?
Is there shrimp on it?	Yes.
Yes.	If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...	I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.	Well, let's see what we get.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.	Who are you?
Who are you?	I'm a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.	You can't come here.
You can't come here.	Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.	No.
No.	Please.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.	You've been retained?
You've been retained?	Yes.
Yes.	Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.	Who did they get for that?
Who did they get for that?	You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Dolores?	It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.

The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.	You think someone else caused the accident?
You think someone else caused the accident?	Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
So you're just the thing we need.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?	Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Are you expensive?	No.
No.	If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.

Are you a reporter?	No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.	In what way?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.	Any criminal record?
Any criminal record?	Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.	Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.	How does the family survive?
How does the family survive?	Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?	Yes.
Yes.	What time in the morning was this?
What time in the morning was this?	About eight-thirty in the morning.
About eight-thirty in the morning.	Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.	Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?	Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
Yes.	And where did you sit that morning?
And where did you sit that morning?	My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.	And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?	Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
No.	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?	Yes.
Yes.	You remember that much?
You remember that much?	As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.	There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.

You are?	Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?	Before the actual accident?
Before the actual accident?	Yes.
I was scared.	Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?	This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?	Yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.	Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?	Dolores was driving too fast.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?	The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.	You could see the speedometer?
You could see the speedometer?	Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?	Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour.	Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?	Positive.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?	I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
You saw the speedometer?	Yes.
Yes.	Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?	No.
No.	Why not?
Why not?	I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.	There wasn't time?
There wasn't time?	No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.	You remember this?
You remember this?	Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
What do you remember about the accident?	I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
That was great.	Really?
Really?	You're going to blow everyone away.
You're going to blow everyone away.	You mean it?
You mean it?	Of course.
Of course.	You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.	I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
What's so funny?	Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
What took so long?	Nothing.
What's that?	Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.	Does it fit?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.	Don't even try to remember.
How do you like it, Nicole?	The ramp?
The ramp?	Pretty slick, eh?
Pretty slick, eh?	Very slick.
Very slick.	Do you like the colour?
Do you like the colour?	It's okay.
It's okay.	And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
The door needs a lock.	Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.	Oh.  I better get some spackle.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?
You and Mom have a lawyer?	Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.	My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.	But you didn't lose me.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.	What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?	Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.	How will he do that?
How will he do that?	Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
What are you up to, Nicole?	Nothing.
Nothing.	Nothing good on your T.V.?
Nothing good on your T.V.?	As opposed to this T.V.?
Are you sleeping?	No.
No.	Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.	Great.
Great.	You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
What do you mean?	I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.	Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?	Great.
Yes.	How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.	Okay.
What's going to happen to Dolores?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Will the police do anything to her?
Will the police do anything to her?	It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.	She'll move away.
She'll move away.	There's talk of that.
There's talk of that.	Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.	Yeah, right.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.	But Charlene...
But Charlene...	Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.	The Ottos.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.	You don't know that.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...	How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.	It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?	That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!	Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Will you mind your own business!	Hitler!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?	Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!	That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?	Is "he" inside?
Is "he" inside?	But of course...
But of course...	Alone or surrounded?
Alone or surrounded?	A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?	Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?	Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
He's somewhere...	Thanks, I see him...
Come on boys, break it up...	The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Did she accept?	You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.	I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -	Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!	...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.	We're on our way there now...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.	Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!	I guess you're right, but -
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.	I doubt that it matters any more.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.	Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.	And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...	See my mother?
See my mother?	I only had a few hours.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.	Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.	Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?	You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?	Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.	You told him that?
You told him that?	Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?	Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.	That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?	Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.	Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.	I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.	Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!	I'm late for a date with a dame.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?	Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.	If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."	And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?	I see you're full of human feelings...
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.	Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?	Right!
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...	Give me a chance --
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!	Hurry back.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...	You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.	Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...	I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?	No, I wouldn't...
No, I wouldn't...	Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Does he have to be here in our hair?	Why, has he bothered you before?
Why, has he bothered you before?	Is it news to you?
Is it news to you?	Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.	Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --	Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!	Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...	No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.	Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?	He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?	Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---	Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.	You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...	I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.	Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?	May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?	I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!	Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...	No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...	And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.	Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?

Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--	Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.	Why?
Why?	What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...	Did Sidney tell you about it?
Did Sidney tell you about it?	Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
Not being partial, are you?	No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Why are you trembling, dear...?	History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...	But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?	I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...	Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Sidney is a liar!	Who said Sidney?
Who said Sidney?	I said Sidney!...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.	I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?	Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...	I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!	I'm taking up the situation with you now...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...	Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...	A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?	J.J., Steve isn't...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?	No...
No...	Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Susie, I'm sorry if---	Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?	No.  I'm going home.
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!	Susan!...
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.	Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.	Now don't kid a kidder.
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.	This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...	We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?	Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Hello, Harry.	Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.	Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?	Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.	She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.	I don't believe it.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!	Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.	I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
Can I come out?  No.	I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.	You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.	Can I come in for a minute?
Can I come in for a minute?	No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...	I have a message from your sister.
I know Manny Davis.	Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...	Not just this minute, J.J....
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.	You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?	You print them, don't you?
You print them, don't you?	Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!	I didn't say that, J.J.
I didn't say that, J.J.	The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.	I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?	You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.	I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.	Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.	I don't?
I don't?	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...	I'll listen one more minute.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...	Are you finished?
Are you finished?	No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!	Not "we", Sidney, you!
Not "we", Sidney, you!	Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.	Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!	What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
Uh huh.	When?
When?	Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.	You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
I know Steve.  No.	Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!	J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!	How?
How?	Get Steve back his job...please...
Get Steve back his job...please...	He means that much to you...?
He means that much to you...?	Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.	You're picking up my lingo, hon.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.	I read your column every day...
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?	No, I won't...
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.	Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?	With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.	I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.	Can't hurt...
Can't hurt...	Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.	I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.	But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...	No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!	Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!	And who's feet is she on now?
And who's feet is she on now?	Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.	What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?	Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.	What does that mean - integrity?
What does that mean - integrity?	A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...	Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!	Don't go wild, Sidney.
Don't go wild, Sidney.	Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!	But not for anything I did today...
But not for anything I did today...	Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
Are you listening?	How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...	She knows now.
She knows now.	Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.	The man in jail is always for freedom.
Sidney, I told you -	J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -	Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Talk to her, Sidney...	Talk to her yourself...
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!	You're incapable of the truth...
You're incapable of the truth...	Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.	I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.	He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...	- He's got them on him.
- He's got them on him.	...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?	He goes out with girls.
He goes out with girls.	Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?	Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
I thought he would.	Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.	What about?
What about?	Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Could this be that boy?	Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
Bribing me again?	And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?	No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?	Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.	I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	You're sure.  Find out for me.
You're sure.  Find out for me.	Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?	At the bar - Sidney...
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?	No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Avidly.  He was staring.	Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.	He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?	...cigarette girls... And naturally -
...cigarette girls... And naturally -	You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?	In his apartment -
In his apartment -	And where was his wife?
And where was his wife?	I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.	We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?	But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?	That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?	Can you be there by two-thirty?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.	Hello.
Back?	One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Don't you know who that man is?	Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.	Yeah!
Yeah!	And he's a perfect stranger to me.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.	So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?	What kind of an act is this?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?	I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...	What sort of thing?
What sort of thing?	This sort of thing!
This sort of thing!	Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -	Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!	What would you think of me if -
What would you think of me if -	Nothing I didn't think of you before.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.	- that's what I mean!
That's the third time he's called today.	He wants me to break a leg?
He wants me to break a leg?	No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...	It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.	But...
But...	But what?
But what?	That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.	May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Who else phoned?	The renting agent and the tailor.
The renting agent and the tailor.	Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.	It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Help me with two minutes of silence!
Go home, Sally.  It's late...	I hate to see you like this --
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --	Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...	You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???	Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?	Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
You ought to be used to me by now.	I'm used to you...
I'm used to you...	No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.
If that's for me, tear it up!	Take a top coat.
Take a top coat.	And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
What's the matter?	Nothing...
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?	Yes.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...	I know you do, Sidney.
I know you do, Sidney.	Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...	That's no way to talk...
That's no way to talk...	Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...	Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.	If you want me to -
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -	Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?	Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?	Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why me...?	Why not you?
Why not you?	That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"	Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.	Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?	It is a favor, isn't it?
It is a favor, isn't it?	According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
You're talking very fast.	Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!	Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!	Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!	Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -	Did you now?  On which bounce?
Did you now?  On which bounce?	- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.	Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.	Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...	Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.	See me in my office.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?	You tell him, I stutter!
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...	I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?	Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.	We stick in each others craw.
We stick in each others craw.	Yes, but why?
Yes, but why?	Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?	Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?	Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.	Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.	Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...	But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.	I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -	Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.	What ship?
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!	Like you?
Like you?	Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!	I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -	I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?	I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...	I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!	...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -	Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
J.J., if you think -	Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -	Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
I tried to reach you twice -	What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?	Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -	Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -	That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?	He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!	If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -	Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
You haven't told him yet...	I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -	But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.	Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -	But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?	Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -	If the stores are open -
If the stores are open -	And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -	And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?	I made you write a beautiful song...
I made you write a beautiful song...	No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...	Steve, stop it please...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.	Why did you call me?
Why did you call me?	Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?	Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...	No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.	But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.	I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.	Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Steve, I...	But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!	But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...	I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?	Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?	You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
You going to work all day?	I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...	You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.	I can't
I can't	Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.	Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --	I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.	I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.	Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?	That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Please... let... the kids... go...	Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Do you know about the chip?	What chip?
What chip?	They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.	Those lying motherfuckers!
Those lying motherfuckers!	I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
We should abort.	NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Do you have bandages?	In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
My God.	Now listen to me very carefully.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?	No one must follow your work.
No one must follow your work.	Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
No good.	Let me try mine.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?	Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.	No way!
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?	I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.	This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?	My mission is to protect you.
My mission is to protect you.	Yeah?  Who sent you?
Yeah?  Who sent you?	You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?	Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.	What does that mean?
What does that mean?	Liquid metal.
Liquid metal.	Radical.
Radical.	You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Where we going?	We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.	Can I stop by my house?
Can I stop by my house?	Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.	You sure?
You sure?	I would.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?	Max.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?	Anything it samples by physical contact.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?	No.  Only an object of equal size.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?	It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.	Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.	Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.	TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!	Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.	Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Oww!  Why'd you do that?	You told me to.
You have to do what I say?!	That is one of my mission parameters.
That is one of my mission parameters.	Prove it... stand on one foot.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!	Why?
Why?	Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!	Why?
Why?	You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
Swear.	What?
What?	Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Everything.	Cool.
Does it hurt?	I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?	A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Affirmative.	No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".	"Hasta la vista, baby"?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?	Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.	Chill out, dickwad.
Chill out, dickwad.	That's great!  See, you're getting it.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.	No problemo.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.	Smile?
Smile?	Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.	It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?	No.
No.	You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?	No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Torque wrench please.	Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.	You will.
You will.	Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Why do you cry?	You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.	Pain causes it?
Pain causes it?	Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?	No.
Alriight!!  My man!	No problemo.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."	She intends to change the future somehow.
She intends to change the future somehow.	I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!	Dyson.
Dyson.	Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
This is tactically dangerous.	Drive faster.
Drive faster.	The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.	I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.	Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.	I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'll deal with the police.	Remember what I said, you can't...
Remember what I said, you can't...	Trust me.
Drive for a minute.	Where you going?!
We don't have much time.	What?
Is it dead?	Terminated.
Will it melt in there?	Yes.  Throw it in.
No!	I'm sorry, John.
I'm sorry, John.	No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!	I have to go away, John.
I have to go away, John.	Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
It must end here... or I am the future.	I order you not to!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?	Gimme that Phillips right there.
Easy money!	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
So she's pretty cool, huh?	Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.	No shit?
No shit?	Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!
No!  Don't kill him!	It, John.  Not him.  It.
It, John.  Not him.  It.	Alright, it!  We need it!
We're better off by ourselves.	But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.	I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.	Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?	I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Mom?  You okay?	I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?	Uh huh.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.	I love you, John.  I always have.
I love you, John.  I always have.	I know, Mom.  I know.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.	Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
I got it.  Piece of cake.	Go!  I'll finish here.
Ready to rock?	Ready.
John, get out of the way!!	SHOOT!!!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.	Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
I love you.  I always will.	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
They took him from me.	It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.	I know!
I know!	Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.	I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.	Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Kyle, don't go!	There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.	And what it that?
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.	I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.	If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.	I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?	You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
You broke my arm!	There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!	Open the goddamn door!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?	Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Can it be destroyed?	Unknown.
You look like handmade shit.	So do you.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?	Correct.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.	Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?	No.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.	Why him?
Why him?	In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.	Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.	Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?	Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.	Why attack Russia?
Why attack Russia?	Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.	Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?	I have detailed files.
I have detailed files.	I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
The CPU from the first terminator.	Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I must be destroyed.	Can you get us in there, past security?
Is it safe for them here?	Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
It's finally over.	No.  There is another chip.
Are you afraid?	Yes.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --	Please continue...
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!	I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I'm sure it feels very real to you --	On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?	Relax now, Sarah --
Relax now, Sarah --	You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
On all what?	On Furtwngler.
On Furtwngler.	I don't know.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.	Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.	Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.	That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!	Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!	Respect your elders and your betters!
Respect your elders and your betters!	And no elbows on the table!
And no elbows on the table!	Eating is eating... and...
Eating is eating... and...	And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.	Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.	But I promised your mother.
Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.	When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.

When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?	I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.	For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.	I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry.	I'm Steve. What's your name?
I'm Steve. What's your name?	David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.	Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?	I guess so, sir.
I guess so, sir.	You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Where you from, David?	was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess you admire musicians.	Some.
Some.	Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?	I guess it's possible.
I guess it's possible.	So, what does the Russki want?
So, what does the Russki want?	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.	'Dim-shits'?
What the hell are they doing?	They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?	Yes.
Yes.	So what is it?
So what is it?	The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.	What's that mean?
What's that mean?	I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.	Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?	Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.	That's big of him.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.	Five minutes.
Five minutes.	It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?	Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Yes, David?	Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?	Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...	David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?	Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!	You bet.
You bet.	and totally irrelevant.
and totally irrelevant.	Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.	But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
What?	Your manner.
Your manner.	My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?	Yeah.
Yeah.	When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?	With more what? More what?
With more what? More what?	Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.	David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?	Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.	A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.	Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.	What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.	Colonel. Pleasure.
Colonel. Pleasure.	So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?	Not yet.
Not yet.	I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.	Furtwngler's in a different category.
Furtwngler's in a different category.	We're dealing with degenerates here.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.	That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.	Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?	But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?	Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!	Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.	In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.	This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.	There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.	What museum?
What museum?	I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.	No can do.
No can do.	Let Furtwngler go. Please.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.	I have a duty.
I have a duty.	Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.	Then you're going to kill me.
You live here, in Berlin?	Yes.
Yes.	You do shorthand and typing?
You do shorthand and typing?	Yes.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?	Three months.
Three months.	Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?	My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.	Your mother, too.
Your mother, too.	Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.	And your father was executed.
Steve.	There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Think you can get me any of that?	Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.	Mine's the Eleventh.
Mine's the Eleventh.	But... he only wrote nine, Major.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?	No. Ours was damaged.
No. Ours was damaged.	What's in those files?
What's in those files?	The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?	You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
I'm sorry.	Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Major, Major... he's here ...	Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.	Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?	Of course.
Of course.	Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.	What is this, Emmi?
What is this, Emmi?	I can't do this. It's not right.
I can't do this. It's not right.	What's not right?
What's not right?	I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.	Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.	But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.	If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?	I would like to go now, please.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?	I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.	What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.	That is correct.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?	I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.	What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.	I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.	Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?	Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?	I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.	That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?

The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?	That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.	How come?
How come?	Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.
I don't buy that.	It's the truth.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?	I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.	Did you call someone you knew?
Did you call someone you knew?	I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.	Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.	May I ask a question?
May I ask a question?	Sure.
Sure.	When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?	Your guess is as good as mine.
Your guess is as good as mine.	I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...	Tough, tough!
Tough, tough!	Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?	I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?	It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.	Why were they going to arrest you?
Why were they going to arrest you?	I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.	You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?	During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.	You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.	It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.	You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?	If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...	They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?	See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
Steve Arnold...	I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?	Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.	Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?	Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone	Who?
Who?	I wasn't told. I just knew it.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.	How?
How?	I was warned.
I was warned.	Who warned you?
Who warned you?	Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.	What did Goering say?
What did Goering say?	He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.	Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.	Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.
I wish to say something.	Go ahead, be my guest.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.	And what was that?
And what was that?	Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.	Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?	I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.	And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?	What telegram?
What telegram?	'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'	I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have no idea what you're talking about.	The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.	I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.	Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.	I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.	Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.	Then you are wrong.
Then you are wrong.	Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?	We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.	You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?

Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?	have no idea what ordinary people thought.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.	No!
No!	No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.	Tell me about von der Null.
Tell me about von der Null.	Von der Null?
Von der Null?	Yes, von der Null.
Yes, von der Null.	Von der Null?
Von der Null?	How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.	Yes, I know who he is.
Yes, I know who he is.	Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?	That's an outrageous lie!
That's an outrageous lie!	You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?

You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?	Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.	And what did he say?
And what did he say?	He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'	And what happened to Von der Nul?
And what happened to Von der Nul?	I have no idea.
I have no idea.	You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.	I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?	Yes, that's what happened.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.	This is absolute nonsense!
This is absolute nonsense!	Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?

Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?	Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
I have illegitimate children.	What?
What?	I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.	You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Stop this, please, stop this now!	No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.	I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.	But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.	I don't understand what you mean.
I don't understand what you mean.	No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?	Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.	I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.	Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.
Of course I know what that is.	Okay, so what is it?
Okay, so what is it?	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.	Who's conducting?
How can I know such a thing?	I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!	I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?	Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?	It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.	Me? Never.  Never.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.	Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.	Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?	That's what I asked.
That's what I asked.	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?	You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?	Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.	Do you know what's in this archive?
Do you know what's in this archive?	How could I know what's in the archive?
Major.	Helmuth.
Helmuth.	Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?	Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.	The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.	Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.	How could I forget?
Show me.	Show you?
Show you?	Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.	Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...	Do it, Helmuth.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.	Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.	Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?	All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?	What?
What?	One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?	I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.	Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?	You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.	Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...	Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.	Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
I've remembered something else...	Yeah?
Yeah?	Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.	He did?
He did?	One of your people told me.
One of your people told me.	One of my people?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.	Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?	No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.	Never heard of him, who is he?
Never heard of him, who is he?	Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.	Who's he?
Who's he?	Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.

But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.	The Miracle Kid.
The Miracle Kid.	Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.	But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.	He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Oh! The evening before, I see...	Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.	Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.	Yes.
Yes.	Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?	I don't know what you mean, Major.
I don't know what you mean, Major.	When you got to the crescendo.
So, you never heard of him.	Nope.
Nope.	Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?	Sure.
Sure.	He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.	Jeez, and I never heard of him.
You were in insurance before the war.	Right. Claims assessor.
Right. Claims assessor.	Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.	They said I was dogged?
They said I was dogged?	Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.	Like this bandleader.
Like this bandleader.	Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?	First oboe.
First oboe.	I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.	Absolutely not.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -	Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.	Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?	It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.	He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?	Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...	Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.	It was Beethoven's Ninth.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.	Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Yes, Chuck?	Come to the office, please.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	You're late.
Aren't I worth waiting for?	Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?	I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.	The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.	Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.	Alright!
Alright!	Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.	I won't let the fat kid down.
Anything else?	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...	Just what you see, pal.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.	You know your weapons, buddy.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?	All.
You can't to that...	Wrong.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.	That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.	I'll do the same for you sometime.
What do you think?	Great.
Great.	You're a big help.
You're a big help.	Alright, the beige one.
Alright, the beige one.	I hate the beige one.
I hate the beige one.	Don't wear the beige one.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?	I thought you did.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.	
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.	We will, kiddo.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?
What's it to ya?	You must have a girlfriend.
You must have a girlfriend.	That's none of your business.
That's none of your business.	Aha!  Is she young?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?	What's it to ya?
Do you understand?	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.	I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.	Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...	Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.	Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.	No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
So, it's from the future, is that right?	One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.	And you're from the future too?
And you're from the future too?	Right.
Just let me go.	Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
There's so much...	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.	I don't understand...
I don't understand...	Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.	The what?
The what?	Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
You cold?	Freezing.
Freezing.	Come here.
Reese...you got a first name?	Kyle.
Kyle.	Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?	White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
I caught one, back there.	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.
It's okay.  Forget it.	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.	What?
What?	Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
What's he like?	You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.	Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.	John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...	Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?	I volunteered.
I volunteered.	You volunteered?
You volunteered?	It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
I'm sure.	Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.	And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?	You'll learn.
You'll learn.	Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.	John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
Good field-dressing.	You like it?  It's my first.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.
Okay.  Talk some more.	About what?
About what?	About where you're from.
Bag some Z's?	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Thanks a lot.	What's that?
That's where we're going.	Why?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?	What about it?
What about it?	Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...	Molecular-memory.
Molecular-memory.	Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?	That's the way it was told to me.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.	Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.	Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.	That's not my mission.
That's not my mission.	Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Let's go.  Time to move out.	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Kyle?	I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Is this enough?	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
What's that?	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.	You must have had a fun child-
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.	I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...	Hot dogs?
Hot dogs?	I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.	My whole life has been combat.
My whole life has been combat.	I want it to be over for you.
I want it to be over for you.	Not possible.
Not possible.	I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
He'll find us, won't he?	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...	Don't say that.
Don't say that.	If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.	It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.	No.  I'm not.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?	Good fighters.
Good fighters.	That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?	Someone?
Someone?	A girl.  You know.
A girl.  You know.	No.  Never.
So much pain.	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.	And so you feel nothing.
And so you feel nothing.	It's better that way.
It's better that way.	Oh, Kyle.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...	Kyle...
I bet you're ticklish.	Ticklish?
What are you doing?	You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
Sarah.	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
What are you doing?	Cover...our footsteps...
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?	With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--	The year 2027?
And who was the enemy?	SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.	I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?	Yes.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.	Then how are you supposed to get back?
Then how are you supposed to get back?	Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.	Why?
Why?	I didn't build the fucking thing.
I didn't build the fucking thing.	Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...	Surrounded by living tissue.
Surrounded by living tissue.	Of course.
Why were the other two women killed?	Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?	I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.	Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I can help you...	Who is in authority here?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...	I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?	Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.	Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Here, drink some of this...	Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.	They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?	I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.	I can't sleep.
I can't sleep.	Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.	Okay.
Give me the short version.	Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--	That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Here's her driver's license.	You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.	I hate the weird ones.
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.
I know.	I put a cigarette out in it.
Did you reach the next girl yet?	No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.	Send a unit.
Send a unit.	I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.	Call her.
Call her.	I just called.
I just called.	Call her again.
Same shit.	I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.	I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?	To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?	Like shit, boss.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.	Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--	Shut up.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.	Projections were far too optimistic.
Projections were far too optimistic.	Admittedly...
Admittedly...	Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.

My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.	The stock will turn.
The stock will turn.	It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?	Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...

You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.	You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...	What?
What?	Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?	Now, look...
Now, look...	I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.

There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.	Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
I could fight you on this.	You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Are you finished?	No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.	We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.	Did you?  Kudos.
Did you play recently?	Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.

If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.	I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.	Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Goodnight.	I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.

I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.	Seriously?  What did they say?
Seriously?  What did they say?	They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?
Can we talk?	It's okay, dad.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.	Come here...
What is it?	Is this you?

Do you mind if I sit?	Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...	I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.	Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Want anything to drink?	You?
You?	Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Take the picture out.	What's wrong?
What's wrong?	Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.	I don't...
They're watching.	Wha... ?

Get out of my car!	You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.	No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Who are "they?"	I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.	Then, what good are you?
Then, what good are you?	I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.	That's a lie...
That's a lie...	Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.	How?  How could they have gotten anything?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?	They did the same to him as they did to you.
They did the same to him as they did to you.	What are you talking about... ?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?	Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.	They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...	Who the fuck cares?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.
It might be best if we didn't talk.	All I mean is... someone like you...

Scams, con games.  How many?	I don't know.  A lot.
I don't know.  A lot.	Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Who is it?	What do we do?
Who is it?	What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.	What... what do you mean?
What... what do you mean?	It's out of your hands.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?	I'm back from the dead.
I'm back from the dead.	Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...

Who's responsible?!	It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...	You call them...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.	Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
They won't...	They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Where'd you get that... ?	... what... ?
... what... ?	That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
What the fuck are you... ?	Where'd you get that gun?
Where'd you get that gun?	It's mine...
It's mine...	We searched the house.

What are you doing?	Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...	Fuck you.

Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...	Stop talking...
Stop talking...	Nicholas...
Nicholas...	Shut up!
Shut up!	Let me show you...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...	You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...	That's not true...
That's not true...	It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
