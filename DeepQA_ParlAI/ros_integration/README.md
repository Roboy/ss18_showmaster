### 1. Rosbridge Websocket
- in terminal, run 
```
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```

### 2. Start Model
- in a new terminal
- activate virtual environment 
- in `ss18_showmaster/DeepQA_ParlAI/ros_integration` run 
```
python gnlp_ros_srv.py
```

### 3. Test the Service
- in another terminal
- get available services through running `rosservice list`
- run 
```
(catkin_ws)/devel/setup.bash
```
with (catkin_ws) being the location of your catkin workspace such as `Documents/Roboy/catkin_ws`
```
rosservice call /roboy/cognition/generative_nlp/answer "text_input: 'hello'"
```
